<h1> Chapter 11 </h1>
<h1> Melodic Intervals </h1>
</div>

------------------------------------------------------------------------


A musical interval is the distance between two pitches. When the
pitches are consecutive the distance is referred to as a *melodic
interval;* when the pitches are concurrent the distance is referred
to as a *harmonic interval.*

The simplicity of these definitions is deceptive. In real music,
the determination of pitch intervals can be surprisingly complicated.
In this chapter we will discuss Humdrum tools related to melodic
pitch intervals &mdash; specifically the <span class="tool">mint</span>
(melodic interval) and <span class="tool">xdelta</span> commands.
Discussion of harmonic intervals will be delayed until
[Chapter&nbsp;15.](/guide/ch15)


## Types of melodic intervals ##

Example&nbsp;11.1 provides a contrived illustration of seven different
types of melodic intervals. (The corresponding <span
class="rep">kern</span> representation is given on the following
page.) The simplest melodic interval is calculated between successive
pitches within the same voice or part. We might call this a *voiced
melodic interval.* Examples of voiced melodic intervals are the
descending perfect fourth between the first two notes of the upper
part, and the rising semitone at the beginning of the lower part.

**Example 11.1** Types of melodic intervals.

<img src="example-11-1.jpg">

Even within a monophonic score, successive pitches may have one or
more rests interposed between them. Depending on the research task,
the interval spanning across the rest(s) may or may not be considered
important. We might call such intervals *interrupted melodic
intervals.* An example of an interrupted melodic interval is the
ascending perfect fourth in the upper voice between the last note
of the first measure (A4) and the first note of the last measure
(D5).

**Example 11.1 continued.**

```humdrum
**kern	**kern
*staff1	*staff1
*M4/4	*M4/4
=1-	=1-
4.e	2cc
8f	.
4.e	4g
.	8a
[8f	8r
=2	=2
2f]	2dd
4d 4g	4b 4ff
4c 4e 4g	4cc 4ee
*-	*-
```

In some cases, implied melodic intervals may arise by the interaction
of two or more parts. For example, Example&nbsp;11.2 shows a plausible
reinterpretation of the voicings for the first measure. Here the
quarter-note G is presumed to continue from the preceding eighth-note
F rather than from the half-note C. In the context of the original
<span class="rep">kern</span> encoding above, we might call such
intervals *cross-voice melodic intervals.*

**Example 11.2** Possible re-interpretation of opening measure for
Example&nbsp;11.1.

<script>
displayHumdrum(
{
	source: "example-11-2",
	scale: 55,
	spacingLinear: 0.45
});
</script>
<script type="text/x-humdrum" id="example-11-2">

.	8f	.
4.e	4g	2r
.	8a	.
[8f	8r	.
=	=	=
*-	*-	*-
</script>

In the second measure, both parts are encoded using multiple stops.
In the upper part, two successive double stops are encoded. In the
case of multiple-stops, it is common to perceive the outer-most
notes as connected. Hence, the B would resolve to the C and the F
would resolve to the E. We might call such intervals *unvoiced outer
intervals.* We may call them *unvoiced* because they aren't encoded
using separate spines. The voicings are implied, principally because
the notes form an 'upper' or 'lower' part.

The multiple-stops in the lower voice illustrate even more
possibilities. Apart from the unvoiced outer intervals (D&rarr;C
and G&rarr;G), there are other possible melodic intervals. These
include D&rarr;E and G&rarr;E. We might refer to such intervals as
*unvoiced inner intervals.*

In many research tasks (such as identifying melodic variations),
important interval relationships may stretch across several intervening
notes. In Example&nbsp;11.1, for example, the two half-notes in the upper
voice might be viewed as forming an ascending major second interval
(i.e. C&rarr;D). We might call such intervals *distance intervals.*

Finally, although in most situations tied notes should be treated
as a single note, in some circumstances there is merit to considering
each notehead as independent.

By way of summary, we have distinguished no less than seven different
types of melodic intervals: voiced melodic intervals, interrupted
melodic intervals, cross-voice melodic intervals, unvoiced outer
intervals, unvoiced inner intervals, distance intervals, and tied
note intervals.

Humdrum commands related to melodic intervals provide users with
several alternative ways of interpreting melodic intervals. Users
are typically interested in only certain types of intervals and so
it is useful to restrict the outputs to specified interval classes.

Apart from the question of types of melodic intervals, melodic
intervals can be calculated according to a variety of *units*.
Depending on the circumstance, the user may wish to calculate
diatonic intervals, semitones, cents, frequency differences, or
even differences in cochlear coordinates.


## Melodic intervals using *mint* ##

The Humdrum <span class="tool">mint</span> command calculates melodic
intervals for pitch-related representations such as <span
class="rep">kern</span>, <span class="rep">pitch</span>, <span
class="rep">solfg</span> and <span class="rep">Tonh</span>. Output
intervals are expressed using the traditional diatonic terms where
both interval quality and interval size are specified. Interval
qualities include perfect (`P`), major (`M`), minor (`m`), augmented
(`A`) and diminished (`d`). Interval qualities may also be doubly
augmented (`AA`), triply diminished (`ddd`) and so on. Diatonic
interval sizes are indicated by numbers (1=unison, 2=second, &hellip;
8=octave, 9=ninth, etc.). Ascending and descending intervals are
distinguished by a leading plus sign (+) or minus sign (-) respectively.

In the default operation, <span class="tool">mint</span> outputs
three of the seven types of melodic intervals. These are *voiced
melodic intervals,* *unvoiced outer intervals* and *interrupted
melodic intervals;* By way of illustration, Example&nbsp;11.3 shows the
output from the <span class="tool">mint</span> command for the input
shown in Example&nbsp;11.1.

**Example 11.3** Default interval outputs from the <span class="tool">mint</span> command
corresponding to Example&nbsp;11.1.

```humdrum
**mint	**mint
*M4/4	*M4/4
=1-	=1-
.	.
+m2	.
-m2	-P4
.	+M2
+m2	r
=2	=2
.	+P4
-m3 +M2	-m3 +m3
-M2 P1	+m2 -m2
*-	*-
```

Notice that the *interrupted interval* (spanning the rest) has been
calculated, and that no unison has appeared for the tied note in
the lower voice.

If desired, the unison intervals between successive tied notes can
be output via the <span class="option">t</span> option for <span
class="tool">mint</span>.

Sometimes it is useful to maintain the initial starting pitches in
the output. The presence of these "offset" pitch values can prove
useful in later reconstructing the original pitches from the <span
class="rep">mint</span> interval data. When the <span
class="option">o</span> option is invoked, <span class="tool">mint</span>
outputs the initial starting pitches (placed in square brackets)
from which the subsequent melodic intervals have been calculated.

In order to avoid outputting interrupted intervals, the <span
class="option">b</span> (break) option can be used. This option
requires a subsequent regular expression that defines the contexts
where the interval calculation should be suspended and restarted.
A common invocation would identify <span class="rep">kern</span>
rests (`r`) as a suitable place to break melodic interval calculations.
For example,

```bash
 mint -b r inputfile
```

would produce the following output when applied to Example&nbsp;11.1:


```humdrum
**mint	**mint
*M4/4	*M4/4
=1-	=1-
.	.
+m2	.
-m2	-P4
.	+M2
+m2	r
=2	=2
P1	.
-m3 +M2	-m3 +m3
-M2 P1	+m2 -m2
*-	*-
```

Notice that the perfect fourth (+P4) has been replaced by a null
token at the beginning of measure 2. In addition, the rest token
`r` has been echoed just prior to the barline.

Depending on the regular expression given, the <span
class="option">b</span> option can used for a variety of specialized
intervals. For example, suppose that we wanted to avoid calculating
intervals between the last note of a phrase and the first note of
the next phrase. In the <span class="rep">kern</span> representation,
the open and closed curly braces are used to indicate the beginnings
and ends of phrases. We need to tell <span class="tool">mint</span>
to break interval calculations each time an end-of-phrase signifier
is encountered:

```bash
mint -b '}' inputfile
```

Similarly, the <span class="rep">kern</span> representation uses
the semicolon (`;`) to represent pauses. We might instruct <span
class="tool">mint</span> to avoid calculating intervals between
notes having pauses and the subsequent note:

```bash
mint -b ';' inputfile
```

Since the <span class="option">b</span> option accepts regular
expressions, we can combine patterns. For example, the following
command instructs <span class="tool">mint</span> to calculate melodic
intervals, not including intervals spanning phrase boundaries, and
not following notes with pauses:

```bash
mint -b '[;}]' inputfile
```


## Unvoiced inner intervals ##

Unvoiced inner intervals can be included in the output by using the
<span class="option">i</span> or <span class="option">I</span>
options. With the <span class="option">I</span> option, unvoiced
inner intervals appear in the output in parentheses. For example,
the following output is generated for Example&nbsp;1.1 with the <span
class="option">I</span> option.  Notice the addition of `(+M2)` and
`(-2)`. The rising major second arises from the pitches D4 and E4;
the falling minor third arises from the pitches G4 and E4.


```humdrum
**mint	**mint
*M4/4	*M4/4
=1-	=1-
.	.
+m2	.
-m2	-P4
.	+M2
+m2	r
=2	=2
P1	.
-m3 +M2	-m3 +m3
-M2 (+M2) (-m3) P1	+m2 -m2
*-	*-
```

With the <span class="option">i</span> option, the parentheses
surrounding the unvoiced inner intervals would be omitted.


## Calculating distance intervals using *mint -s* ##

Another option provided by <span class="tool">mint</span> is the
<span class="option">s</span> or skip option. Like the <span
class="option">b</span> option, this option requires a subsequent
regular expression. Any token matching this expression is transformed
to a null data token and is ignored when processing. One possible
use for this option is to help calculate *distance intervals.*
Consider Example&nbsp;11.4 where all of the durations are either sixteenth
notes or eighth notes. Suppose we wanted to calculate the intervals
only between the eighth notes.

**Example 11.4**

<table class="plain" width="100%">

</td>
</tr>
</table>

We can use the skip option to instruct <span class="tool">mint</span>
to ignore any note token matching the string `16`:

```bash
 mint -s 16 inputfile
```

This command would produce an output that highlights the descending
arpeggiated major chord &mdash; from C5 to G4 (down a P4), to E4 (down a m3)
to C4 (down a M3).

Using duration information is a somewhat limited technique for
calculating distance intervals. Typically, users will want to define
much more refined ways of identifying structural tones. More
sophisticated methods for calculating distance intervals are discussed
in [Chapter&nbsp;35](/guide/ch35) on "Layers."

Cross-voice melodic intervals can be calculated by amalgamating
several spines into a single spine. In [Chapter&nbsp;26](/guide/ch26)
we will learn more about the <span class="tool">cleave</span>
command. But here is a typical use:

```bash
cleave -d ' ' -i '**kern' -o '**kern' example11a
```

With the <span class="rep">kern</span> encoding for Example&nbsp;11.1
as input, the corresponding output would be:


```humdrum
**kern
*M4/4
=1 =1
4.e 2cc
8f
4.e 4g
8a
[8f 8r
=2 =2
2f] 2dd
4d 4g 4b 4ff
4c 4e 4g 4cc 4ee
*-
```

Note that this output doesn't quite conform to the <span
class="rep">kern</span> syntax: the barlines have been duplicated
as double-stops, and the durations aren't right for multiple-stops.
We can clean up the output using <span class="tool">humsed</span>,
but the incoherent durations won't cause problems if our intention
is to calculate pitch intervals.

If we pipe the above output through the <span class="tool">mint</span>
command, the appropriate command pipeline becomes:

```bash
cleave -d ' ' -i '**kern' -o '**kern' example11a \
     | humsed 's/ =.*//' | mint -I
```

The corresponding melodic interval output is:

```humdrum
**mint
*M4/4
=1-
.
+m2 -P5
-m2 +M2
+P4 +M2
-M3 r
=2
+P4
-m3 (+M2) (-P5) (+A4) (-m3) +m3
-M2 (-m3) (-P5) (P1) (-M3) (+P4) (+m2) -m2
*-
```


## Simple and compound melodic intervals ##

Of course, some melodic variants alter the octave placement of
pitches.  The <span class="tool">mint -c</span> option outputs
compound intervals (i.e.  intervals of an octave or greater) as
non-compound equivalents. For example, the interval of a major tenth
(`M10`) will be output as a major third (`M3`).


## Diatonic intervals, absolute intervals and contour ##

The <span class="tool">mint</span> command provides three further
options of interest. The <span class="option">d</span> option causes
<span class="tool">mint</span> to output only the diatonic interval
size without the interval quality information. The <span
class="option">a</span> option causes <span class="tool">mint</span>
to output absolute pitch intervals without distinguishing ascending
intervals from descending intervals. That is, the leading plus (+)
and minus (-) signs are discarded.

Finally, the <span class="option">A</span> option causes <span
class="tool">mint</span> to output just one of three states: a plus
sign `+` indicating a rising interval, the minus sign `-` indicating
a falling interval, and the number zero `0` indicating no pitch
movement (i.e., unison). In short, the <span class="option">A</span>
option outputs only gross contour. The <span class="option">a</span>
and <span class="option">A</span> options are complementary.


## Using the *mint* command ##

Consider some of the following uses of the <span class="tool">mint</span>
command.

Are there any major or minor ninth melodic intervals in the file
`Sinatra`?

```bash
mint Sinatra | grep '[Mm][9]'
```

Are there any compound melodic intervals in the file `Piaf`?

```bash
mint Piaf | egrep '([Mm][9])|([MmPAd][1-9][0-9]''
```

Are descending seconds more common than ascending seconds in melodies
by Maurice Chevalier?

```bash
mint Chevalier* | grep -c '+[Mm]2'
mint Chevalier* | grep -c '-[Mm]2'
```

An alternative way of achieving the same goal might simplify the
regular expression to <span class="unix">grep</span> and use the
<span class="option">d</span> (diatonic) option for <span
class="tool">mint</span>:

```bash
mint -d Chevalier* | grep -c '+2'
mint -d Chevalier* | grep -c '-2'
```

Identify whether there are any tritone melodic intervals in any of
the vocal parts of a score:

```bash
extract -i '*Ivox' Platters | mint -c | egrep '(A4)|(d5)'
```

Here we have used the extended regular expression capabilities of
<span class="unix">egrep</span> to specify an either/or pattern.

Suppose we had a directory containing only files encoding melodies
using the <span class="rep">mint</span> representation. Does any
melody in the current directory contain both an ascending major
sixth and a descending major sixth?

```bash
grep -l '+M6' * | xargs grep '-M6'
```

Do the vocal lines of Louis Jourdain contain successive ascending
major thirds (such as forming an augmented triad)?

```bash
mint Jourdain | grep -v = | uniq -d | grep '+M3'
```

What is the longest run of rising intervals in the vocal lines of
Marlene Dietrich?

```bash
mint -A Dietrich | grep -v = | uniq -cd | grep '+' | sort -n
```


## Calculating melodic intervals using *xdelta* ##

Often it is useful to calculate melodic intervals in purely numerical
values, such as the number semitones or the number of cents. The
<span class="tool">xdelta</span> command provides a general tool
for calculating numerical differences between successive values
within individual spines. In order to use <span class="tool">xdelta</span>
to calculate semitone differences, we first need to transform our
representation to <span class="rep">semits</span> (discussed in
[Chapter&nbsp;4](/guide/ch04)). Recall that in the <span
class="rep">semits</span> representation, middle C is designated
by the value zero, and all other pitches are represented by their
(positive or negative) semitone distance. A C-major scale would
appear as follows:

```humdrum
**semits
0
2
4
5
7
9
11
12
*-
```

We can transform this representation to semitone intervals as follows:

```bash
xdelta inputfile
```

For the above scale, the output would be:

```humdrum
**Xsemits
.
2
2
1
2
2
2
1
*-
```

Notice that the initial numerical value has been replaced by a null
token, and all subsequent values represent the numerical *difference*
between successive values. If the scale had been descending in
pitch, then the difference values would be negative.

Notice also that the input interpretation (<span class="rep">semits</span>)
has been modified to <span class="rep">Xsemits</span>). The input
representation for <span class="tool">xdelta</span> does not matter.
The output is always modified so the letter X is prepended to the
representation. This means that <span class="tool">xdelta</span>
could as easily be used to calculate differences in cents (<span
class="rep">Xcents</span>), frequency (<span class="rep">Xfreq</span>)
or any other representation that contains numbers.

When <span class="tool">xdelta</span> encounters multiple-stops,
it behaves in a manner similar to the <span class="tool">mint</span>
command by calculating the numerical equivalent of unvoiced inner
intervals. Consider the following example:

```humdrum
**semits
3
2 5
-1 7 14
12
*-
```

The <span class="tool">xdelta</span> command produces the following output:

```humdrum
**Xsemits
.
-1 2
-3 (5) (2) 9
13 5 -2
*-
```

Once again, the interpretation has been modified to <span
class="rep">Xsemits</span> and the leading value has been changed
to a null token. In going from the value 3 to the values 2 and 5,
the output differences are -1 and +2 respectively. In going from
the values 2 and 5 to the values -1, 7 and 14, we see the outer
differences (-1 - 2 = -3) and (14 - 5 = 9). The inner differences
are output in parentheses: (7 - 2 = 5) and (7 - 5 = 2).

Like the <span class="tool">mint</span> command, <span
class="tool">xdelta</span> provides a <span class="option">b</span>
option to break calculations of numerical differences and a <span
class="option">s</span> option to skip or completely ignore certain
data tokens when processing. An important use of the <span
class="option">s</span> option is to ignore barlines. Consider the
following example:

```humdrum
**cents
100
400
800
=2
600
*-
```

The proper way to calculate differences in cents is to ensure that
measure numbers are ignored:

```bash
xdelta -s ^= inputfile
```

Failure to skip the barline will cause a difference to be calculated
between 800 and =2 (i.e., -798) and between =2 and 600 (i.e., 598).

Outputs from <span class="tool">xdelta</span> can be processed again
using <span class="tool">xdelta</span> in order to calculate the
differences of the differences. For example, we can calculate the
second derivative of successive cents by using a pipeline containing
two <span class="tool">xdelta</span> commands:

```bash
xdelta -s ^= inputfile | xdelta -s ^=
```


## Reprise ##

Intervals come in a mind-boggling range of types and sizes. Interval
sizes can be measured in a variety of ways. They can be characterized
as diatonic qualities such as minor sevenths or augmented sixths.
They can be measured in terms of semitone distance &mdash; or even
in cents or hertz (frequency difference). Only the diatonic size
may be of interest (e.g., "a fifth"), and compound intervals (e.g.,
major tenth) can be expressed by their non-compound equivalents
(major third).

Melodic intervals can be described as ascending or descending, or
as absolute distances without regard for direction. Types of melodic
intervals can be distinguished according to how successive notes
are voiced, and according to spans across rests or across less
important pitches. We defined seven different types of melodic
intervals including *voiced melodic intervals*, *interrupted melodic
intervals*, *cross-voice melodic intervals*, *unvoiced outer
intervals*, *unvoiced inner intervals*, *distance intervals*, and
*tied note intervals*.

In this chapter we have seen how to use the <span class="tool">mint</span>
command to calculate these various kinds of intervals. Specifically,
we have illustrated how to calculate voiced intervals, interrupted
intervals, unvoiced outer intervals and unvoiced inner intervals.
In [Chapter&nbsp;26](/guide/ch26) we will show how to calculate cross-voice
intervals, and in [Chapter&nbsp;35](/guide/ch35) ("Layers") we will
consider how to calculate distance intervals.

We have also seen how <span class="tool">xdelta</span> can be used
to measure purely numerical distances between successive values.
As we will see, <span class="tool">xdelta</span> will prove useful
in many other applications apart from calculating pitch distances.
