<h1> Humdrum: A Brief Tour </h1>
</div>

------------------------------------------------------------------------


Humdrum is a general-purpose software system intended to assist
music researchers. Humdrum's capabilities are quite broad, so it
is difficult to describe concisely what it can do. This chapter
provides a brief tour through Humdrum: the goal is to give you a
quick glimpse of Humdrum's capabilities and to help sketch some of
the big picture. Don't worry if you don't understand everything in
this chapter. All of the topics mentioned here will be covered more
thoroughly in later chapters.



## What Can Humdrum Do? ##


Although Humdrum facilitates exploratory investigations, it is best
used when the user has a clear problem or question in mind. For
example, Humdrum allows users to pose and answer questions such as
the following:

*   In the music of Stravinsky, are dissonances more common in strong
    metric positions than in weak metric positions?
*   In Urdu folk songs, how common is the so-called "melodic arch" &mdash;
    where phrases tend to ascend and then descend in pitch?
*   What are the most common fret-board patterns in guitar riffs by Jimi
    Hendrix?
*   Which of the Brandenburg Concertos contains the B-A-C-H motif?
*   Which of two different English translations of Schubert lyrics best
    preserves the vowel coloration of the original German?
*   Did George Gershwin tend to use more syncopation in his later works?
*   After the V-I progression, which harmonic progression is most apt to
    employ a suspension?
*   How do chord voicings in barbershop quartets differ from chord
    voicings in other repertories?
*   In what harmonic contexts does HÃ¤ndel double the leading-tone?

Although the Humdrum tools may take just seconds to compute an
answer for any of the above problems, only a few of these questions
are *easy* to answer using Humdrum. The primary impediment to a
quick solution is the user's skill in interconnecting the right
tools for the task at hand. The purpose of this book is to help you
develop that skill.



## The Humdrum Syntax and the Humdrum Toolkit ##



Humdrum consists of two distinct components: the *Humdrum Syntax*
and the *Humdrum Toolkit.* The *Humdrum Syntax* is a grammar for
representing information. Over the course of this book we'll encounter
a variety of representation schemes that conform to this syntax.
The syntax itself doesn't represent anything: it merely provides a
common framework for representing all sorts of information. Within
the syntax an endless number of representation schemes can be
defined.  Theoretically, any type of sequential symbolic data may
be accommodated &mdash; such as medieval square notation, MIDI data,
acoustic spectra, piano fingerings, changes of emotional states,
Indian tabla notations, dance steps, Schenkerian graphs, concert
programs &mdash; or even industrial chemical processes.

A number of representation schemes are pre-defined in Humdrum;
however, users are free to concoct their own task-specific
representations as necessary. For example, if you are interested
in Telugu notation or Dagomba dance, you can design your own pertinent
representation scheme within the Humdrum syntax. Humdrum representations
may be meticulously crafted, or they may be invented in a matter
of seconds. It is common to generate intermediate or "throw-away"
representations that are used only for a single research task.

The *Humdrum Toolkit* is a set of more than 70 inter-related software
tools. These tools manipulate ASCII data (text) conforming to the
Humdrum syntax. If the ASCII data represents music-related information,
then we can say that the Humdrum tools manipulate music-related
information.

What kinds of manipulations can be done with Humdrum? The various
Humdrum tools can be grouped roughly into the following sixteen
types of operations.

*   **Visual display.** E.g., display a score beginning at measure 128;
    output the libretto from Act II, Scene 5; print the string parts for
    the Coda &mdash; including the Roman numeral harmonic analysis.
*   **Aural display.** E.g., play the bass trombone part slowly
    beginning at measure 70; play just the opening two measures from all
    of the works in a given repertory.
*   **Searching.** E.g., search for instances of a motive; locate any
    deceptive cadences; find all of the works that are composed for a
    given combination of traditional Japanese instruments.
*   **Counting.** E.g., how often do augmented intervals occur in
    Hungarian folk songs? What proportion of phrases do not begin with a
    pick-up or anacrusis?
*   **Editing.** E.g., change all up-stems to down-stems in measure 88
    of the second horn part.
*   **Editorializing.** E.g., add an editorial footnote to a specified
    note; indicate that a passage differs from the composer's
    autograph.
*   **Transforming or translating between representations.** E.g.,
    transpose from one key to another; calculate the harmonic intervals
    between two parts; represent a score according to scale-degrees;
    reconstitute chords so they are represented in set *normal form*.
*   **Arithmetic transformations of representations.** E.g., calculate
    the semitone spacings between successive notes, or determine points
    where parts cross in pitch.
*   **Extracting or selecting information.** E.g., extract the second
    verse; exclude the development section; isolate the third phrase;
    grab the second chord in each measure; select the brass parts; take
    the second endings when repeating the trio; choose the Dresden
    manuscript version.
*   **Linking or joining information.** E.g., assemble instrumental
    parts into a full score; tag notes with their harmonic function;
    coordinate heart-rate data from a listener with the musical score.
*   **Generating inventories.** E.g., list all the types of
    embellishment (non-chordal) tones from the most common to the least
    common; what chord functions are absent from a work?
*   **Classifying.** E.g., classify all chords as "open" or "closed"
    position; identify all secondary dominants; classify all intervals
    as either unisons, steps or leaps; classify various piano fingerings
    as either easy, moderate, difficult, or impossible.
*   **Labelling.** E.g., mark musical sections; label themes; identify
    French, Italian and German sixth chords; mark appropriate words in a
    vocal text as either "passionate," "apathetic," or "neutral."
    Mark sonorities as falling on either strong or weak metric
    positions.
*   **Comparison.** E.g., determine whether the Amsterdam and Manchester
    manuscripts for a work have identical pitches in the third movement;
    determine whether motets by John Dunstable are more similar to
    motets by Thomas Morley or by Lionel Power.
*   **Capturing Data.** E.g., import live or recorded MIDI data; import
    data from a notation program.
*   **Trouble-shooting.** E.g., identify any transgressions of
    notational conventions; check whether a score has been tampered
    with; get help when you're stuck.

If the above functions sound vague, that's because the corresponding
Humdrum tools are similarly broad in their function. For example,
the Humdrum <span class="tool">patt</span> tool can be used to
locate Landini cadences, label statements of 12-tone rows, or search
for piano fingering patterns in Liszt. All three tasks involve
searching for a sequential pattern that might have concurrent
features as well.

When using computers in research activities, it is important to
maintain a keen awareness of their limitations. For example, computers
are typically not good at *interpreting* data. Because much music
scholarship hinges on interpretations, this would seem to preclude
computers from being of much use. However, there are some things
that computers do well, and when a skilled user intervenes to make
a few crucial interpretations, the resulting computer/human interaction
can lead to pretty sophisticated results &mdash; as we will see.

Although computers are typically not good at interpreting data,
interpretive software will become increasingly important as
computational musicology continues to develop. Humdrum provides a
handful of tools that *interpret* data in various ways. For example,
the <span class="tool">key</span> command implements the Krumhansl
and Kessler method for estimating the key of a music passage. The
<span class="tool">melac</span> command implements Joseph Thomassen's
model of melodic accent. Other interpretive tools characterize
syncopation or implement Johnson-Laird's model of rhythmic prototypes.

The names of some of the Humdrum tools will be readily recognizable
by musicians. Humdrum tools such as <span class="tool">key</span>,
<span class="tool">pitch</span>, <span class="tool">record</span>,
<span class="tool">tacet</span>, <span class="tool">trans</span>
and <span class="tool">reihe</span> may evoke fairly accurate ideas
about what they do. Ironically, the most recognizable tools are
typically the least useful tools in the toolkit &mdash; because
they are so specialized.  The most powerful Humdrum tools have names
such as <span class="tool">cleave</span>, <span class="tool">humsed</span>,
<span class="tool">simil</span>, <span class="tool">recode</span>,
<span class="tool">context</span>, <span class="tool">patt</span>
and <span class="tool">yank</span>.

By itself, each individual tool in the Humdrum Toolkit is quite
modest in its effect. However, the tools are not intended to be
self-sufficient. They are designed to work in conjunction with each
other, and with existing standard UNIX commands. Like musical
instruments, their potential usefulness is greatly increased when
they are combined with other tools. Musical problems are typically
addressed by linking together successive Humdrum (and UNIX) commands
to form one or more command *pipelines.* Although each individual
tool may have only a modest effect, the tools' combined capacity
for solving complex problems is legion.

Now that we've sketched an overview of Humdrum, we can consider in
greater detail the two principal components of Humdrum: the *Humdrum
Syntax* and the *Humdrum Toolkit*.



## Humdrum Syntax ##


Humdrum data are organized somewhat like the tables of a spread-sheet.
As with a spreadsheet, you can define or label your own types of
data.  As with a spreadsheet, the different *columns* can be set
up to represent whatever type of data you like. The *rows* of data,
however, have a fixed meaning &mdash; they represent successive
moments in time; that is, time passes as you move down the page.

By way of example, consider Table&nbsp;1.1. This table shows something
akin to a piano-roll. The diatonic pitches are labelled in columns
from C4 (middle C) to C5. Each row represents the passage of a
sixteenth duration. The table entries indicate whether the note is
*on* or *off*.  The table encodes an ascending scale. As the table
stands, it's not clear whether each note has a duration of an eighth
note or whether two successive sixteenth notes are sounded for each
pitch:

**Table 1.1**

<style>
table.simple tr, table.simple td {
	padding: 0;
	margin: 0;
	line-height: 24px;
	padding-left: 40px;
	margin-left: 40px;
	border-collapse: collapse;
	background: transparent !important;
}
tr.bold td {
	font-weight: bold;
	color: dodgerblue;
}
td.on {
	color: crimson;
	font-weight: bold;
}
table.table11 tr td:nth-child(2) {
	color: dodgerblue;
	font-weight: bold;
}
</style>

<table class="plain simple table11">
<tr class="bold"><td></td><td></td><td>C4</td><td>D4</td><td>E4</td><td>F4</td><td>G4</td><td>A4</td><td>B4</td><td>C5</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>&#x1d161;&nbsp;&nbsp;#1</td><td class="on">ON</td><td>off</td><td>off</td><td>off</td><td>off</td><td>off</td><td>off</td><td>off</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>&#x1d161;&nbsp;&nbsp;#2</td><td class="on">ON</td><td>off</td><td>off</td><td>off</td><td>off</td><td>off</td><td>off</td><td>off</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>&#x1d161;&nbsp;&nbsp;#3</td><td>off</td><td class="on">ON</td><td>off</td><td>off</td><td>off</td><td>off</td><td>off</td><td>off</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>&#x1d161;&nbsp;&nbsp;#4</td><td>off</td><td class="on">ON</td><td>off</td><td>off</td><td>off</td><td>off</td><td>off</td><td>off</td></tr>
<tr><td style="font-weight:bold;">time</td><td>&#x1d161;&nbsp;&nbsp;#5</td><td>off</td><td>off</td><td class="on">ON</td><td>off</td><td>off</td><td>off</td><td>off</td><td>off</td></tr>
<tr><td style="font-weight:bold; text-align:center;">&darr;</td><td>&#x1d161;&nbsp;&nbsp;#6</td><td>off</td><td>off</td><td class="on">ON</td><td>off</td><td>off</td><td>off</td><td>off</td><td>off</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>&#x1d161;&nbsp;&nbsp;#7</td><td>off</td><td>off</td><td>off</td><td class="on">ON</td><td>off</td><td>off</td><td>off</td><td>off</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>&#x1d161;&nbsp;&nbsp;#8</td><td>off</td><td>off</td><td>off</td><td class="on">ON</td><td>off</td><td>off</td><td>off</td><td>off</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>&#x1d161;&nbsp;&nbsp;#9</td><td>off</td><td>off</td><td>off</td><td>off</td><td class="on">ON</td><td>off</td><td>off</td><td>off</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>&#x1d161;&nbsp;&nbsp;#10</td><td>off</td><td>off</td><td>off</td><td>off</td><td class="on">ON</td><td>off</td><td>off</td><td>off</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>&#x1d161;&nbsp;&nbsp;#11</td><td>off</td><td>off</td><td>off</td><td>off</td><td>off</td><td class="on">ON</td><td>off</td><td>off</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td colspan="9">etc.</td></tr>
</table>

Table&nbsp;1.2 shows another example where different kinds of information
are combined in the same table. Here the last column represents a
combination of trumpet valves:

**Table 1.2**

<style>
table.table12 {
	margin-left: auto;
	margin-right: auto;
}

table.table12 td, table.table12 th {
	text-align: center;
	padding-left: 40px;
	padding-right: 40px;
}
table.table12, table.table12 * {
	border: 0;
}
</style>

<table class="table12 plain simple">
<tr><th>Note #</th><th>Pitch</th><th>Duration</th><th>Valves</th></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>C4</td><td>quarter</td><td>0</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>B3</td><td>eighth</td><td>2</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>G4</td><td>eighth</td><td>0</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>F4</td><td>eighth</td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>G4</td><td>eighth</td><td>0</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>A4</td><td>quarter</td><td>1-2</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>G4</td><td>eighth</td><td>0</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Ab4</td><td>quarter</td><td>2-3</td></tr>
</table>

Humdrum representations can be very similar to the data shown in
Tables 1.1 and 1.2. With just a few formatting changes, either table
can be transformed so that it conforms to the Humdrum syntax. For
example, Table&nbsp;1.3 recasts Table&nbsp;1.2 so that it conforms to the
Humdrum syntax.  Just four changes have been made: (1) the left-most
column has been given a heading name so that *every* column has a
label, (2) each column heading is preceded by two asterisks, (3)
the columns have been left-justified so successive columns are
separated by a tab, and (4) each column has been terminated with
the combination of an asterisk and hyphen.

**Table 1.3** A Humdrum file equivalent to Table 1.2

```humdrum
**Note	**Pitch	**Duration	**Valves
1	C4	quarter	0
2	B3	eighth	2
3	G4	eighth	0
4	F4	eighth	1
5	G4	eighth	0
6	A4	quarter	1-2
7	G4	eighth	0
8	Ab4	quarter	2-3
*-	*-	*-	*-
```

It does not matter what characters appear in the table &mdash;
numbers, letters, symbols, etc. (although there are some restrictions
concerning the use of spaces and tabs). The table can have as many
columns as you like, and can be as long as you like. Unlike spreadsheet
columns, Humdrum "columns" can exhibit complicated "paths" through
the document; columns can join together, split apart, exchange
positions, stop in mid-table, or be introduced in mid-table. Humdrum
also allows subsidiary column headings that can clarify the state
of the data.  Subsidiary headings can also be added anywhere in
mid-table. Finally, Humdrum also provides ways of adding running
commentaries; comments might pertain to the whole table, to a given
row or column, to a given data cell, or to a particular item of
information within a cell (such as a single letter or digit). Since
the *columns* in Humdrum data can roam about the table in a
semi-flexible way, they are referred to as
[**spines.**](glossary.html#Spines) We'll see how these devices are
used in later chapters.

The most common Humdrum files encode musical notes in the various
cells of the table; the most common use of a spine is to represent
a single musical part or instrument.

Some twenty or more representation schemes are pre-defined in
Humdrum, but remember that users are always free to concoct their
own representations as necessary. As in a spread-sheet, the spines
or columns can be used to represent whatever you like. In the
following chapter, we'll look at the most commonly used of the
pre-defined Humdrum representations &mdash; the *kern* representation.
This representation gets its name from the German word for *core*;
it is a scheme intended to represent the basic or core musical
information of notes, durations, rests, barlines, and so on.



## Humdrum Tools ##



The Humdrum software is not a program that you invoke like a
word-processor or notation editor. Humdrum is not a big program
that you start-up when you want to do music research. Instead,
Humdrum provides a toolbox of *utilities* &mdash; most of which can
be accessed at any time from anywhere in the system.

Any data that conforms to the Humdrum syntax can be manipulated
using the Humdrum software tools. Since the tools can be interconnected
with each other (and can also be interconnected with non-Humdrum
tools) there are a lot of ways to manipulate Humdrum data. Much of
this book will deal with how the tools can be interconnected to do
musically useful things.

For the remainder of this chapter, we will describe a few Humdrum
tools and illustrate how they might be used. Once again, the goal
in this chapter is to give you an initial taste of Humdrum. Don't
worry if you don't understand everything at this point.



## Some Sample Commands ##



One group of tools is used to extract or select sections of data.
Vertical spines of data can be extracted from a Humdrum file using
the <span class="tool">extract</span> command. For example, if a
file encodes four musical parts, then the <span class="tool">extract</span>
command might be used to isolate one or more given parts. The command

```bash
extract -f 1 filename
```

will extract the first or left-most column or spine of data. Often it is
useful to extract material according to the encoded content without
regard to the position of the spine. For example, the following command
will extract all spines containing a label indicating the tenor part(s).

```bash
extract -i '*Itenor' filename
```

Instruments can be labelled by "instrument class" and so can be
extracted accordingly. The following command extracts all of the
woodwind parts:

```bash
extract -i '*ICww' filename
```

Any vocal text can be similarly extracted:

```bash
extract -i '**text' filename
```

Or if the text is available in more than one language, a specific
language may be isolated:

```bash
extract -i '*LDeutsch' filename
```

Segments or passages of music can be extracted using the <span
class="tool">yank</span> command. Segments can be defined by sections,
phrases, measures, or other any user-specified marker. For example,
the following command extracts the section labelled "Trio" from a
minuet & trio:

```bash
yank -s Trio -r 1 filename
```

Or select the material in measures 114 to 183:

```bash
yank -n = -r 114-183 filename
```

Or select the second-last phrase in the work:

```bash
yank -o { -e } -r '$-1' filename
```

Don't worry about the complex syntax for these commands; the command
formats will be discussed fully in the ensuing chapters. For now,
it is important only that you get a feel for some of the types of
operations that Humdrum users might perform.

Two or more commands can be connected into a *pipeline.* The following
command will let us determine whether there are any notes in the
bassoon part:

```bash
extract -i '*Ifagot' filename | census -k
```

The following pipeline connects together four commands: it will
play (using MIDI) the first and last measures from a section marked
"Coda" at half the notated tempo from a file named `Cui`:

```bash
yank -s '*>Coda' Cui | yank -o ^= -r 1,$ | midi | perform -t .5
```

Some tools translate from one representation to another. For example,
the <span class="tool">mint</span> command generates melodic interval
information. The following command locates all tritones &mdash;
including compound (octave) equivalents:

```bash
mint -c filename | egrep -n '((d5)|(A4))'
```

Incidentally, Humdrum data can be processed by many common commands
that are not part of the Humdrum Toolkit. The <span
class="unix">egrep</span> command in the above pipeline is a common
computer utility and is not part of the Humdrum Toolkit.

Depending on the type of translation, the resulting data can be
searched for different things. The following command identifies
French sixth chords:

```bash
solfa file | extract -i '**solfa' | ditto | grep '6-.*4+' | grep 2
```

Locate all sonorities in the music of Machaut where the seventh
scale degree has been doubled:

```bash
deg -t machaut* | grep -n '7[^-+].*7'
```

Count the number of phrases that end on the subdominant pitch:

```bash
deg filename | egrep -c '(}.*4)|(4.*})'
```

The following command identifies all scores whose instrumentation
includes a tuba but not a trumpet:

```bash
grep -sl '!!!AIN.*tuba' * | grep -v 'tromp'
```

Some tasks may require more than one command line. For example, the
following three-line script locates any parallel fifths between the
bass and alto voices of any input file:

```bash
echo P5 > P5  echo '= *' >> P5; echo P5 >> P5  extract -i '*Ibass,*Ialto' file | hint -c | pattern -s = P5
```

More complicated scripts can be written to carry out more sophisticated
musical processes. In later chapters we'll encounter some scripts
that contain 10 or more lines of commands.


## Reprise ##

In this chapter we have seen that Humdrum consists of two parts:
(1) a representation *syntax* that is similar to tables in a
spread-sheet, and (2) a set of utilities or *tools* that manipulate
Humdrum data in various ways. The tools carry out operations such
as displaying, performing, searching, counting, editing, transforming,
extracting, linking, classifying, labelling and comparing. The tools
can be linked together to carry out a wide variety of tasks. Even
one-line commands can carry out sophisticated operations. A few
lines of Humdrum can also be used to write programs of some complexity.
Users can write their own programs using the Humdrum tools, or they
can add new tools that augment the functioning of Humdrum.
