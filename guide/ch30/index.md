<h1> Chapter 30 </h1>
<h1> MIDI Input Tools </h1>
</div>

------------------------------------------------------------------------


The Humdrum Toolkit provides two tools for inputting MIDI data. In this
chapter we briefly introduce the [**record**](/tool/record) and
[**encode**](/tool/encode) commands. These tools provide ways
for capturing MIDI input and translating them to representations that
conform to the Humdrum syntax. The **record** command translates a live
or computer-generated MIDI performance to the
[`**MIDI`](/rep/MIDI) representation. The **encode**
command provides an interactive editor that translates MIDI events to
any pre-defined or user-defined Humdrum representation.

Note that the Humdrum **record** and **encode** commands are currently
available only for the DOS operating system. These commands can be used
only with computers that have MIDI capable hardware.


The *record* Command
--------------------

The [**record**](/tool/record) command captures a stream of
input MIDI data and translates this data into the Humdrum `**MIDI`
representation described in [Chapter 7.](/guide/ch07) The input data is
obtained from a MIDI instrument such as a keyboard synthesizer.

Recording commences as soon as the command is invoked and recording
ceases when any key is pressed \-- with the exception of the space bar.
Pressing the space bar causes a `**MIDI` barline token to be output.
Measure numbers are incremented automatically beginning with measure 1.

Only MIDI key-press activity (including after-touch) information is
recorded. MIDI "system-exclusive" instructions and other non-key-press
data are not recorded.

Each MIDI channel is represented using a separate Humdrum spine. New
spines are added automatically during the recording in response to MIDI
activity appearing in any MIDI channel. Once a MIDI channel becomes
active, the corresponding Humdrum spine continues to be output until the
recording is terminated.

The recorded output is normally directed to a file as in the following:

```bash
record > filippa
```


The *encode* Command
--------------------

The [**encode**](/tool/encode) command provides an interactive
editor for capturing Humdrum data from a MIDI input, such as a keyboard
synthesizer. MIDI events are mapped to user-defined signifiers so
**encode** can be used to enter data directly into a particular
representation such as [`**kern`](/rep/kern),
[`**fret`](/rep/fret),
[`**solfg`](/rep/solfg), etc. Since the mapping of
MIDI events to Humdrum data tokens is arbitrary, users can enter data
using a representation design by the user.

The **encode** command is limited to encoding information one spine at a
time. A typical use of **encode** is to encode individual musical parts
or voices using a representation like \*\*kern. A full score is
generated from the individual parts using the
[**timebase**](/tool/timebase) and
[**assemble**](/tool/assemble) commands.

The **encode** command implements a full-screen interactive editor
similar to the **vi** text editor. When invoked, the screen is divided
into three display regions, including a *status window*, a *command
window*, and a larger *text window*. The *status window* displays
various items of basic information about the file being edited. The
**command window** allows the user to execute general-purpose commands
to manipulate the data. The **text window** is used to display, encode
and edit the encoded Humdrum text.

When the **encode** command is invoked, its operation is determined by a
configuration file (that may be written or edited by the user). This
configuration file contains a series of definitions that map MIDI events
to output strings. For example, the instruction

```bash
KEY 60 middle-C
```

assigns the key-on event for MIDI key \#60 to the string `middle-C`.
Each time key \#60 is depressed, the string `middle-C` will appear in
the text window.

Such mappings can be made for each individual MIDI key. In addition, the
user may define mappings for *key velocity*. For example, the following
instruction in the configuration file will map any key-velocities
between 90 and 127 MIDI units to the apostrophe character (the
[`**kern`](/rep/kern) signifier for a staccato
note):

```bash
VEL 90 127 '
```

A third class of mapping instructions relates to the elapsed time
between MIDI key onsets \-- "delta time" or DEL. Consider, for
example, the following configuration instructions:

```bash
DEL 48 80 8
```
```bash
DEL 81 112 8.
```
```bash
DEL 113 160 4
```
```bash
DEL 161 224 4.
```
```bash
DEL 225 320 2
```

These instructions divide the elapsed time between key onsets into five
ranges. When the elapsed time lies between 48 and 80 clock ticks, the
string "`8`" is output. When the elapsed time lies between 81 and 112
clock ticks, the string "`8.`" is output. And so on. This allows the
durations to be classified as either an eighth note, a dotted eighth
note, a quarter note, a dotted quarter note, or a half note. Once again,
the user is free to map events to any arbitrary output string and to
arrange the ranges and number of classes as needed.

The Humdrum Toolkit provides a large selection of predefined
configuration files for use with **encode**. Depending on the
configuration, the input may be mapped to a particular representation
such as \*\*kern. For example, Humdrum provides a configuration file
that is optimized for encoding lute tablatures using the \*\*fret
representation. Other configuration files are optimized for particular
keys. For example, one may select a configuration file that interprets
the MIDI events in the key of C\# minor; in this case, playing the pitch
C will result in a default encoding of B\#.

The **encode** command provides many additional features that facilitate
encoding Humdrum data from a MIDI input device. These include setting
metronome values, assigning the beat, rearranging the order of
signifiers, making global and local substitutions, replaying an
interpreted input, defining buffers and string constants, and so on.
Using the configuration files, users can tailor the **encode** editor to
suit specific needs and skills.

In this chapter we have briefly identified two tools for capturing
MIDI-related input: [**encode**](/tool/encode) and
[**record**](/tool/record). These tools allow MIDI data to be
translated to a Humdrum format. Further information regarding these
tools is given in the *Humdrum Toolkit Reference Manual.*
