Chapter 8
========

The Shell (I)
=============

When you type commands, they are interpreted by a command *shell.* The
shell is a program that interprets user commands before passing them
along to be executed. Command shells are quite sophisticated and provide
a number of useful features. Although there is a lot to learn about
shells, we will explore only those features that facilitate use of
Humdrum. This chapter is the first of four chapters scattered throughout
this book where we will pause and examine some of the more pertinent and
valuable features of the shell.

In UNIX environments, many different shells have been developed over the
years. The original UNIX shell was the *C-shell* \-- a shell whose
syntax is similar to the C programming language. A later shell was
developed by Stephen Bourne and is known as the *Bourne shell.*
Subsequent improvements by David Korn resulted in the *Korn shell.* The
Bourne shell was improved in light of many features introduced in the
Korn shell, and resulted in the *Bourne Again Shell* \-- known as
*Bash*. The Korn and Bash shells are the most popular and powerful of
the current generation of shells. Although they were originally
developed for the UNIX operating system, these shells are also available
for DOS, Macintosh, Windows, Windows 98 and many other operating
systems.

Shells themselves are advanced programming languages that provide
complex control structures. When you type a command, you are already
writing a program \-- although most of your programs are just one line
in length.

<a name ="Shell_Special_Characters"></a>

Shell Special Characters
------------------------

The shell interprets a number of characters in a special manner. When
you type a command, you should know that most shells treat the following
characters as having a special meaning: the octothorpe (\#), the
dollar-sign (\$), the semicolon (;), the ampersand (&), the verticule
(\|), the asterisk (\*), the apostrophe (\'), the greve (\`), the
greater-than sign (\>), the less-than sign (\<), the question-mark (?),
the double-quote (\"), and the backslash (\\). We\'ll consider the
function of each of these characters one at a time.

<a name ="File_Redirection"></a>

File Redirection (\>)
---------------------

Some of the special shell characters have already been discussed. The
greater-than-sign (\>) is a *file redirection operator.* It must be
followed by a user-specified filename; any output from the preceding
command is placed in the specified file. For example, the following
command sorts the file `inputfile` and places the sorted result in the
file named `outputfile`:

```bash
sort inputfile > outputfile
```

If the file `outputfile` already existed, its contents will be destroyed
and over-written with the new output. Be careful not to assign the
output to the same file as the input, since this will destroy the
original input file.

Sometimes it is useful to *add* the results of an operation to some
already existing file. The double greater-than-sign (\>\>) causes the
new output to be appended to any data already in the named file. For
example, the following command sorts the file `inputfile` and adds the
sorted lines to the end of the file named `outputfile`. If the
`outputfile` does not already exist, the command will create it.

```bash
sort inputfile >> outputfile
```

<a name ="Pipe_(|)"></a>

Pipe (\|)
---------

The vertical bar (\|) is interpreted by the shell as a \`pipe.\' Pipes
are used to join the output of one command to the input of a subsequent
command. For example, in the following construction, the output of
`command1` is routed as the input to `command2`:

```bash
command1 | command2
```

There is no practical limit to the length of a pipeline. Several pipes
can be used to connect successive outputs to ensuing commands:

```bash
command1 | command2 | command3 | command4
```

<a name ="Shell_Wildcard_(*)"></a>

Shell Wildcard (\*)
-------------------

The asterisk is interpreted by the shell as a \"filename wildcard.\"
When it appears by itself, the asterisk is \`expanded\' by the shell to
a list of all files in the current directory (in alphabetical order).
For example, if the current directory contained just three files:
`alice`, `barry` and `chris` \-- then the following command would be
applied to all three files in consecutive order:

```bash
command * > people
```

The file expansion occurs at the moment when the command is invoked. So
although the file `people` is added to the current directory, it is not
included as its own input. However, if the above command was executed a
second time, then the file expansion would include `people` \-- even as
the file itself is over-written to receive the output. Including the
output file as input is never a good idea.

<a name ="Comment_(octothorpe)"></a>

Comment (\#)
------------

The octothorpe character (\#) indicates a shell *comment*. Any
characters following the \# (up to the end of the line) are simply
ignored by the shell. The following is not a command:

```bash
#grep OTL: filename
```

The comment can begin anywhere in the line. Here the comment begins
after the filename:

```bash
grep OTL: filename   # (Search for Humdrum titles.)
```

Escape Character (\\)
---------------------

Sometimes we would like to have a special character treated literally.
For example, suppose we wanted to search for records containing sharps
in a [`**kern`](/rep/kern) file. The following
command will not work because the shell will insist on interpreting the
octothorpe as beginning a comment:

```bash
grep # filename
```

There are several ways to \"turn off\" the special meaning of a
character. The simplest way is to precede the character by a backslash
(\\) as in the following command:

```bash
grep \# filename
```


The backslash character itself can be treated literally by preceding it
with another backslash. For example, the following command searches for
down-stems in a `**kern` file:

```bash
grep \\ filename
```

Escape Quotations (`'...`\')
----------------------------

Another way of escaping the special meaning of shell characters is to
place the material in single quotes. For example, we can escape the
meaning of the octothorpe (\#) by preceding and following it by single
quotes:

```bash
grep '#' filename
```

<a name ="McCartney"></a>

Single quotes are especially useful for binding spaces. For example, the
following command searches for the phrase \"Lennon and McCartney\" in a
file named `beatles`:

```bash
grep 'Lennon and McCartney' beatles
```

If the single quotes are omitted, the command means something completely
different. The following command searches for the string \"Lennon\" in
three files named `and`, `McCartney` and `beatles`:

```bash
grep Lennon and McCartney beatles
```

A common mistake is to fail to match quotation marks in a command. The
shell will assume that the command is incomplete until all quotation
marks are matched (both single quotes and double quotes). In the
following example, we have failed to match the quotation mark. When we
press the return key, the shell responds with a change of prompt
indicating that it is waiting for us to complete the command.

```bash
grep '# inputfile > outputfile  >
```

<a name ="Command_Delimiter_(;)"></a>

Command Delimiter (;)
---------------------

The semicolon (;) indicates the end of a command. Its presence allows
more than one command to be typed on a single line. For example, the
following line:

```bash
command1 ; command2
```

is logically identical to:

```bash
command1 \
command2
```

When both commands appear on the same line, they are still executed
sequentially, so the second command doesn\'t begin until the first is
completed. Although the ability to place two or more commands on a
single line may seem redundant, there are a number of circumstances
where this feature proves useful.

<a name ="Background_Command_(&)"></a>

Background Command (&)
----------------------

After typing a command, the command begins executing as soon as you type
the carriage return or \"enter\" key. When the command has finished
executing, the shell will display a new command prompt. Sometimes a
command can take a long time to execute so it will be awhile before the
prompt is displayed again. Unfortunately, you must wait for the prompt
before you can type a new command. On multitasking systems it is
possible for the computer to execute more than one command concurrently.
The ampersand (&) can be used to execute a command as a *background
process*. When a command is ended by an ampersand, the shell creates an
independent process to handle the command, and the shell immediately
returns with a prompt for a new command from the user. UNIX systems
provide sophisticated mechanisms for controlling concurrent processing
of commands. For further information concerning these features, refer to
a UNIX reference book.

<a name ="Shell_Command_Syntax"></a>

Shell Command Syntax
--------------------

Shell commands follow a special syntax. There are six possible
components to a common command:

-   the command name,
-   one or more options,
-   one or more option parameters,
-   a command argument,
-   one or more input file names,
-   output redirection.

Each of these components is separated by \`blank space\' (tabs or
spaces). A command begins with the command name \-- such as **uniq**,
**sort**, or [**pitch**.](/tool/pitch) A command argument is a
special requirement of only some commands. A good example of a command
argument is the search pattern given to the **grep** command. In the
following command, **grep** is the command name, \"Lennon\" is the
command argument and `beatles` is the input file name:

```bash
grep Lennon beatles
```

For most commands, it is possible to process more than one input file.
These files are simply listed at the end of the command. For example,
the following **grep** command searches for the string \"McCartney\" in
the file `beatles` and in the file `wings`:

```bash
grep McCartney beatles wings
```

Most commands provide *options* that modify the behavior of the command
in some way. Command options are designated by a leading dash character.
The specific option is usually indicated by a single alphabetic letter,
such as the **-b** option (spoken: \"dash-B\" option). In the **uniq**
command, the **-c** option causes a count to be prepended to each output
line. In the following command, **uniq** is the command name, **-c** is
the option, and `ghana32` is the name of the input file:

```bash
uniq -c ghana32
```

In many cases, the option is followed by a *parameter* that specifies
further information pertaining to the invoked option. In the following
command, [**recode**](/tool/recode) is the command name, **-f**
is the option, **reassign** is the parameter used by the **-f** option,
and **gagaku** is the name of the input file:

```
recode -f reassign gagaku
```

Options and their accompanying parameters must be separated by blank
space (i.e. one or more spaces and/or tabs). If more than one option is
invoked, and none of the invoked options require a parameter, then the
option-letters may be combined. For example, the **-a** and **-b**
options might be invoked as **-ab** (or as **-ba)** \-- provided neither
option requires a parameter.

Whenever an option requires a parameter, the option must be specified
alone and followed immediately by the appropriate parameter. For
example, in the following command, the command name is
[**trans**,](/tool/trans) the **-d** option is followed by the
numerical parameter **3**; the parameter for the **-c** option is the
number **4** and the input file is named **gambia21**.

```bash
trans -d 3 -c 4 gambia21
```

Since numerical parameters can sometimes be negative, it can be
difficult to discern whether a negative number is a parameter or another
option. In the following example, the **-3** is a parameter to the
**-d** option rather than an option by itself.

```bash
trans -d -3 -c 2 gambia21
```

<a name ="Output_Redirection"></a>

Output Redirection
------------------

Most commands support several input and output modes. Input to a command
may come from three sources. In many cases the input will come from one
or more existing files. Apart from existing files, input may also come
from text typed manually at the terminal, or from the output of
preceding commands. When input text is entered manually it must be
terminated with an end-of-file character (control-D) on a separate line.
(On Microsoft operating systems the end-of-file character is control-Z.)
When input is received from preceding commands, the output is sent via a
UNIX pipe (\`\|\') as discussed above.

The different ways of providing input to a command are illustrated in
the following examples. In the first example, the input (if any) is
taken from the terminal (keyboard). In the second example, the input is
*explicitly* taken from a file named `input`. In the third example, the
input is *implicitly* taken from a file named `input`. In the fourth
example, the input to **command2** comes from the output of
**command1**.

```bash
command \
command < input \
command input \
command1 | command2
```

Outputs produced by commands may similarly be directed to a variety of
locations. The default output from most commands is sent to the terminal
screen. Alternatively, the output can be sent to another process (i.e.
another command) using a pipe (\|). Output can also be stored in a file
using file redirection operator (\`\>\') or *added* to the end of a
(potentially) existing file using the file-append operator (\`\>\>\').
In the first example below, the output is sent to the screen. In the
second example, the output is sent to the file `outfile`; if the file
`outfile` already exists, its contents will be overwritten. In the third
example, the output is appended to the end of the file `outfile`; if the
file `outfile` does not already exist, it will be created. In the fourth
example, the output is sent as input to the command **command2**.

```bash
command  command > outfile  command >> outfile  command1 | command2
```

When two or more commands have their inputs and outputs linked together
using the pipe operator (`|`), the entire command line is known as a
*pipeline.* Pipelines occur frequently in Humdrum applications.

<a name ="Tee"></a>

Tee
---

A special shell command known as **tee** can be used to clone a copy of
some output, so that two identical output streams are generated. In the
first example below, the output is piped to **tee** which writes one
copy of the output to the file `outfile` and the second copy appears on
the screen. In the second example, the output from **command1** is
split: one copy is piped to **command2** for further processing, while
an identical copy is stored in the file `outfile1`; if the file
`outfile1` already exists, its contents will be overwritten. In the
third example, the append option (**-a**) for **tee** has been invoked
\-- meaning that the output from `command` will be added to the end of
any existing data in the file `outfile`. If the file `outfile` does not
already exist, it will be created.


```bash
command | tee outfile  command1 | tee outfile1 | command2 > outfile2  command | tee -a outfile
```


The **tee** command is a useful way of recording or diverting some
intermediate data in the middle of a pipeline.

<a name ="Reprise"></a>

Reprise
-------

In this chapter we have noted that the shell interprets certain
characters in a special way. We learned about the octothorpe (\#), the
ampersand (&), the verticule (\|), the asterisk (\*), the apostrophe
(\'), the greater-than sign (\>), the semicolon (;), and the backslash
(\\). In a later chapter we\'ll discuss the remaining special
characters: the dollar-sign (\$), the apostrophe (\'), the less-than
sign (\<), the question-mark (?), and the double-quote (\"),

We have also reviewed the syntax for UNIX commands. Commands can include
components such as the *command name*, *options*, *parameters*, *command
arguments*, *input files* and *output redirection*.
