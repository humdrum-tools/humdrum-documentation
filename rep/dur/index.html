Humdrum Representation for Duration
===================================

### REPRESENTATION

> **\*\*dur** \-- duration (time-span) representation

### DESCRIPTION

> The **\*\*dur** representation can be used to encode a sequence of
> time-spans or successive durations. Units may be seconds, minutes,
> hours, days, months, and/or years.
>
> In the **\*\*dur** representation, duration information is encoded
> according to the following basic syntax:
>
> *years**/**months**/**days**/**hours**:**minutes**:**seconds**.**decimal*
>
> Duration information may be encoded in full, or may consist of
> isolated elements or parts. The following table shows the most
> succinct ways of encoding single duration values within **\*\*dur**:
>
> >   -------- -------------------------------
> >   `.11`    11 one-hundredths of a second
> >   `11`     11 seconds
> >   `11:`    11 minutes
> >   `11::`   11 hours
> >   `11/`    11 years
> >   `/11`    11 months
> >   `//11`   11 days
> >   -------- -------------------------------
> >
> > *Examples of **\*\*dur** components*
>
> Notice that if a single numerical value appears, it is interpreted as
> *seconds*. For example, the data token ` 32` represents a duration of
> 32 seconds. If a single value appears followed by a slash, it is
> interpreted as the number of *years*; if a single value appears
> followed by a colon, it is interpreted as the number of *minutes*.
> Days and hours require two leading or two trailing delimiters
> respectively. In general, abbreviated forms of **\*\*dur**
> representations tend to favor the two extremes of durations: in
> seconds and in years.
>
> The data token ` 1:15:10` represents a duration of one hour fifteen
> minutes and 10 seconds. It is also possible to encode such durations
> in seconds alone as in the equivalent \-- ` 4510.` If only a single
> colon is encountered, it is presumed to delineate minutes and seconds
> as in ` 5:33` (five minutes and 33 seconds).
>
> The data token ` 53/` means an elapsed duration of 53 years, whereas
> ` /9//` means a duration of 9 months. The data token ` //730/` means
> 730 days.
>
> The **\*\*dur** representation provides a means for representing
> approximate durations. It also provides a means for representing
> uncertainty, as well as mechanisms for representing time boundaries
> (prior to \...; after \...).
>
> If a duration token is preceded by the tilde (\~) signifier, the
> entire data token is taken to be *approximate.* Hence, the token
> ` ~1/` signifies a duration of about 1 year and the token ` ~3` means
> a duration of about 3 seconds.
>
> If a duration token is preceded by the question mark (?), the duration
> is taken to be uncertain. Hence, the token ` ?3:` signifies a duration
> of perhaps 3 minutes.
>
> The **\*\*dur** representation does not support the \`x\' and \`z\'
> signifies used by related representations such as **\*\*date** and
> **\*\*Zeit.** However, **\*\*dur** is able to represent shorter-than
> (\<) and longer-than (\>) indications. For example, the data token
> ` <1:` means a duration of less than one minute.
>
> Barlines are represented using the \"common system\" for barlines \--
> see [**barlines**](barlines.rep.html).

### FILE TYPE

> It is recommended that files containing predominantly `**dur` data
> should be given names with the distinguishing \`.dur\' extension.

### SIGNIFIERS

> The following table summarizes the **\*\*dur** mappings of signifiers
> and signifieds.

> >   /     years-months, months-days and days-hours delimiter
> >   :     hours-minutes and minutes-seconds delimiter
> >   .     fractional second delimiter; null token
> >   ?     duration uncertain
> >   \~    duration approximate
> >   \<    duration shorter than
> >   \>    duration longer than
> >   =     barlines

### PERTINENT COMMANDS

> The following Humdrum command produces **\*\*dur** data as output:
>
[**dur**](../commands/dur.html)

change canonical durations (`**recip) to elapsed time in seconds   `

### TANDEM INTERPRETATIONS

> The following tandem interpretations can be used in conjunction with

> >   meter signatures   `*M6/8`
> >   tempo              `*MM96.3`
