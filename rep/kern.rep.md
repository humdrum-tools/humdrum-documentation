Humdrum Representation for Basic Notated Music
==============================================

### REPRESENTATION

> **\*\*kern** \-- core pitch/duration representation for common
> practice music notation

### DESCRIPTION

> The **\*\*kern** scheme can be used to represent basic or core
> information for period-of-common-practice Western music. The
> **\*\*kern** representation allows pitch and canonical duration
> information to be encoded. In addition, **\*\*kern** also provides
> limited capabilities for representing accidentals, articulation,
> ornamentation, ties, slurs, phrasing, barlines, stem-direction and
> beaming. In general, **\*\*kern** is intended to represent the
> underlying semantic information implied by a musical score rather than
> the visual or orthographic information embodied by a given printed
> rendition; **\*\*kern** is designed to facilitate analytic
> applications rather than music printing or sound generation. Other
> Humdrum representations should be used for these latter purposes.
>
> Three types of data tokens are distinguished in **\*\*kern**: notes,
> rests, and barlines.
>
> Notes can encode a variety of attributes including absolute pitch,
> accidental, canonical duration, articulation, ornamentation, ties,
> slurs, phrasing, stem-direction and beaming.
>
> Pitches in **\*\*kern** are encoded as \"nominally\" equally-tempered
> values. Transposing instruments are represented at concert pitch with
> a tandem interpretation indicating the nature of the transposition.
> Pitch information is encoded through a scheme of upper- and lower-case
> letters. Middle C (C4) is represented using the single lower-case
> letter `c`. Successive octaves are designated by letter repetition,
> thus C5 is represented by `cc`, C6 by `ccc` and so on. For pitches
> below C4, upper-case letters are used: `C` for C3, `CC` for C2, and so
> on. This same scheme is used for other pitch letter-names. Changes of
> octave are deemed to occur between B and C. Thus the B below middle
> `c` is represented as `B`; the B below `CC` is represented as `BBB`,
> and so on.
>
> Accidentals are encoded using the octothorpe (`#`) for sharps, the
> minus sign (`-`) for flats, and the lower-case letter `n` for
> naturals. Accidentals are encoded immediately following the diatonic
> pitch information. Double-sharps and double-flats have no special
> representations in **\*\*kern** and are simply denoted by repetition
> `(##)` and `(--)`. Triple- and quadruple accidentals are similarly
> encoded by repetition. Sharps, flats, and naturals are mutually
> exclusive in **\*\*kern,** so tokens such as `cc#n` and `GG-#` are
> illegal. In addition, natural signs may not be repeated (i.e. `nn`).
>
> In **\*\*kern,** all pitches are encoded as contextually independent
> absolute values. Pitches must be encoded with the appropriate
> accidental, even if the accidental is specified in a key-signature, or
> is present earlier in the same measure. Transposing instruments must
> be notated at (sounding) concert pitch (although see the tandem
> interpretation **transposition (3)**).
>
> Note tokens may be modified by the presence of additional signifiers.
>
> The **\*\*kern** representation provides no generic means for
> representing \"curved lines\" found in printed scores. Lines must be
> explicitly interpreted as ties, slurs or phrases. The open brace `{`
> denotes the beginning of a phrase. The closed brace `}` denotes the
> end of a phrase. The open parenthesis `(` and closed parenthesis `)`
> signify the beginning and end of a slur respectively. The semicolon
> `;` denotes a pause. The open square bracket `[` denotes the first
> note of a tie. The closed square bracket `]` denotes the last note of
> a tie. The underscore character `_` denotes middle notes of a tie.
>
> Additional signifiers are provided for denoting articulation marks and
> ornaments. The letters `T` and `t` are used to signify whole-tone and
> semitone trills, respectively. Whole-tone and semitone mordents are
> signified by the letters `M` and `m`. Inverted mordents are signified
> by `W` (whole-tone) and `w` (semitone). (Note that trills, mordents,
> and inverted mordents wider than two semitones in size are also
> denoted by the upper-case signifier.) The letter `S` signifies a turn,
> whereas the dollar sign (`$`) signifies an inverted (or Wagnerian)
> turn. When a concluding turn is appended to the end of an ornament
> (such as a trill), the upper-case letter `R` is added to the ornament
> signifier (as in `tR` and `TR`). In addition to these ornaments,
> **\*\*kern** provides a signifier for (multi-note) arpeggiation (`:`).
> The presence of ornaments other than trills, mordents, inverted
> mordents, and turns types can be indicated by the generic ornament
> symbol (`O`).
>
> Articulation marks include the apostrophe (`'`) for staccato, the
> double-quote (`"`) for pizzicato, the greve (`` ` ``) for
> staccatissimo or attacca, the tilde (`~`) for tenuto, and the caret
> (`^`) for all note-related accents (including \< and \>). In addition,
> **\*\*kern** provides signifiers for up-bow (`v`) and down-bow (`u`).
> The presence of other articulation types can be indicated by the
> generic articulation symbol (`I`).
>
> As noted, the **\*\*kern** scheme is intended for analytic
> applications rather than as a means for representing visual renderings
> of notation. Nevertheless, **\*\*kern** distinguishes up-stems,
> down-stems, and beamings in order to assist in analytic tasks such as
> the determination of voicings and in order to facilitate the parsing
> of note-groupings. Up-stems and down-stems are indicated by the slash
> (`/`) and backslash characters (`\`) respectively. The beginning and
> ends of beams are signified by the upper-case letters `L` and `J`.
> Multiple beams are indicated via letter repetition, e.g. `LL <--> JJ`
> and `LLL <--> JJJ` for double- and triple-beams respectively. Partial
> beams may extend to the right (`K`) or left (`k`). Again, multiple
> partial beams are indicated via letter repetition. By way of example,
> a doubly-dotted sixteenth note beamed to a thirty-second note can be
> represented as:
>
> > ``
> >
> >   --------
> >   16..LL
> >   32JJkk
> >   --------
> >
> Slurs and phrase markings can be nested (e.g. slurs within slurs) and
> may also be elided (e.g. overlapping phrases). Nested markings mean
> that one slur or phrase is entirely subsumed under another slur or
> phrase. For example: `(   (   )    )` means that a short slur has
> occurred within a longer slur. Elisions are overlaps, for example,
> where an existing phrase fails to end while a new phrase begins. In
> **\*\*kern** the ampersand character is used to mark elided slurs or
> phrases. For example: `{   &{   }    &}` means that two phrases
> overlap \-- the initial phrase ending after second phrase has begun.
> Multiple levels of elisions are indicated by repeating the ampersand
> character. Both the beginning and ending must be marked by the same
> number of ampersands. For example, the following coding represents a
> series of elided phrases where three separate phrases begin before any
> of the phrases is terminated: { &{ &&{ } &&} &} Notice that the second
> elided phrase terminates after third phrase has ended.
>
> *Durations* are encoded in a manner identical to the
> [**\*\*recip**](recip.rep.html) representation. Durations are encoded
> as nominal proportions using integer numbers and the period character.
> With the exception of the value zero, durations are represented by
> reciprocal numerical values corresponding to the American duration
> names: `1` for whole note, `8` for eighth, `32` for thirty-second,
> etc. The number zero (`0`) is reserved for the *breve* duration (i.e.
> a duration of twice the length of a whole note). Dotted durations are
> indicated by adding the period character (`.`) immediately following
> the numerical value \-- hence `8.` signifies a dotted-eighth note and
> `2..` signifies a doubly-dotted half note. Any number of augmentation
> dots may follow the duration integer.
>
> Triplet and other irregular durations are represented using the same
> reciprocal logic. Three quarter triplets in the time of four quarters
> (a whole duration) are signified by the value `3` (i.e. \"third
> notes\"). Eighth-note quintuplets (5 in the time of 4) are represented
> by the value `10` (a half duration divided by 5). See
> [**\*\*recip**](recip.rep.html) for further details.
>
> The **\*\*kern** representation also allows for the encoding of
> acciaccaturas, non-canonical groupettos, and appoggiaturas. Depending
> on the expected analytic application, one way to handle these
> notational devices is to encode the notes according to the manner in
> which they are typically performed. Alternatively, since these notes
> are viewed as embellishment notes and hold potentially less analytic
> status, a special designation for these notes can be useful for
> certain types of studies.
>
> Acciaccaturas (grace notes) are visually represented as minature notes
> denoted by a slash mark through the stem. In **\*\*kern** these notes
> are treated as \"durationless\" notes and are designated by the
> lower-case letter `q`. Hence, the token `G#q` denotes a G\#3
> acciaccatura. Non-canonical groupettos are minature (non-cue) notes
> (typically in groups) whose stems do not contain a slash, and whose
> notated durations cause the total notated duration for the measure to
> exceed the prevailing meter. These groupetto notes are encoded as
> notes having their notated durations, but are also designated by the
> upper-case letter `Q`. Hence, a minature sixteenth-note middle C would
> be encoded as `16cQ`. Depending on the analytic task, these notes may
> be treated as equivalent to their notated durations, or they may be
> discarded. For example, the [**timebase**](../commands/timebase.html)
> command eliminates these notes. Note that data records containing
> acciaccaturas or groupettos notes must not include normal notes.
>
> In the case of appoggiaturas, **\*\*kern** requires that they be
> encoded as performed. An appropriate duration is assigned to the
> appoggiatura according to common performance practice. The duration of
> the subsequent note is reduced by a corresponding amount. The status
> of the two notes forming the appoggiatura is nevertheless marked. The
> appoggiatura itself is designated by the upper-case letter `P`,
> whereas the subsequent note (whose notated duration has been shorted)
> is designated by the lower-case letter `p`.
>
> Rest tokens are denoted by the lower-case letter `r` along with a
> numerical duration signifier. Rests may also have the attributes of
> stem-direction, beaming, slur, and phrase, but rests cannot be
> assigned articulation or ornamentation attributes. In many meters, a
> full measure of rest is indicated by a whole rest, even if the actual
> duration of the measure differs from four quarters. The actual
> duration of the rest is encoded, however, repetition of the `r` is
> used to indicate that the visual rendering of the rest is as a whole
> rest.
>
> Barlines are represented using the \"common system\" for barlines \--
> see [**barlines**](barlines.rep.html). A barline is denoted by the
> occurrence of an equals sign (`=`) at the beginning of the token \--
> followed by an optional measure number (integer) followed by an
> optional letter (single lower-case alphabetic character), followed by
> an optional pause marking (`;`). Double-barlines are represented by
> the occurrence of two or more equals signs (`==`) at the beginning of
> the token \-- followed by an optional pause marking (`;`).
>
> In representing any work, editorial interpretations are inevitable. It
> may be necessary to make explicit certain implicit information in a
> score (such as expanding abbreviations), or it may be necessary to
> estimate missing or unreadable information. Interpreting the voicings
> (that is, making explicit the degree of connectedness between
> successive pitches) is an important editorial function in **\*\*kern**
> representations. The **\*\*kern** representation provides several
> special-purpose signifiers to help make explicit various classes of
> editorial amendments, interpretations, or commentaries. Five types of
> editorial signifiers are made available: (1) *sic* (information is
> encoded literally, but is questionable) signified by `Y`; (2)
> *invisible symbol* (unprinted note, rest or barline, but logically
> implied) signified by `y`; (3) *editorial interpretation,* (a
> \"modest\" editorial act of interpretation \-- such as the
> interpretation of accidentals in *musica ficta*) signified by `x`; (4)
> *editorial intervention* (a \"significant\" editorial intervention)
> signified by `X`; (5) *footnote* (accompanying local or global comment
> provides a text commentary pertaining to a specified data token)
> signified by `?`.

### CONTEXT DEPENDENCIES

> In general, signifiers in the **\*\*kern** representation are intended
> to be context independent. This means, for example, that the data
> tokens `{(16ff#/'` and `/ff#16'({` are equivalent. A few exceptions to
> this principle are necessary in order to maintain the meaning of
> multiple-character signifiers.
>
> Numbers encoding a duration must be contiguous. That is, a sixteenth
> note may be encoded as `16ff#` or `ff#16` but not as `1ff#6`.
> Augmentation dots (signified by the period) must follow immediately
> after the associated duration numerals. Thus `16.ff#` is acceptable,
> but not `16ff#.` or `.16ff#`. Sharps, flats, and naturals must follow
> immediately after the corresponding alphabetic pitch signifiers
> (`16ff#` but not `16#ff`). Signifiers that can be repeated must be
> contiguous. This include pp, PP, LL, JJ, XX, xx, ??, \#\#, \--, and ..
>
> The elision marker (`&`) must immediately precede the associated slur
> (`&{ ... &}`) or slur (`&( ... &)`).
>
> Barlines follow a strict contextual syntax. Barlines must begin with
> one or more equals-signs, followed by an optional measure number,
> followed by an optional lower-case letter, followed by an optional
> pause signifier.
>
> In certain applications, it may be necessary to have a canonical
> ordering of the signifiers within **\*\*kern** data tokens. For
> example, when comparing two ostensibly identical **\*\*kern** files,
> trivial differences of signifier orderings will cause UNIX commands
> such as **cmp** and **diff** to declare the files to be \"different.\"
> In this case, it is useful to adopt a standard order of signifiers so
> that direct file comparisons may be made. Similarly, differences in
> signifier orderings can cause problems for pattern matching tasks. For
> example, in searching for a sixteenth-note F-sharp, it is convenient
> to define a simple regular expression \-- such as `16f#` rather than
> having to define a regular expression that handles all possible
> contextual orderings \-- such as `(16.*f#)|(f#.*16)`. For this reason,
> a canonical ordering of the **\*\*kern** signifiers is given in the
> following table.
