	Text incipit
</span>

The text incipit is the first few words of the lyrics.

```
!!!OTL: Frau von Weissenburg
!!!TIN: Was wollen wir aber singen,
```

A language qualifier can be added to describe the language(s) of the incipit(s).


```
!!!OTL: Frau von Weissenburg
!!!TIN@@DE: Was wollen wir aber singen,
!!!TIN@EN: But what shall we sing
```

Where `@@` can be used to indicate explicitly the language of the incipit in the
source, and `@` for its translations.  If there are multiple languages (such as
translated verses in the source, `@` can be used both, or `@@` can be used
for the identifiable original language.  Example encoding equivalent languages:

```
!!!OTL: Frau von Weissenburg
!!!TIN@DE: Was wollen wir aber singen,
!!!TIN@EN: But what shall we sing
```
