## Recording Information ##

Humdrum representations may encode information pertaining to sound
recordings (such as sound-based analyses). For information derived from
sound recordings the following reference records may be pertinent.

## Performance Information ##

Humdrum representations may encode performance-activity information
rather than (or in addition to) score-related information. If the
representation encodes a given performance (such as a MIDI performance), 
then the following reference records may be pertinent.

in the work,  then each performer\'s name should appear on a separate
<span class="refname">MPN</span> record with a number designation prior to the colon.
Note that this record
can be used for soloists, and <b>!!!MGN:</b> is used for the name of 
a group, such as the <i>Chicago Symphony Orchestra</i>, and <b>!!!MCN:</b>
is for the conductor of the group.

<a name ="MPS"></a>

<span class="refname">MPS</span> *Suspected performer*. If more than one performer is

standard **cksum** command can be used to determine whether the file
originates with the publisher,  or whether it has been modified in some
way. (See the Humdrum **veritas** command described in Section 4.) Note
that this validation process is easily circumvented by malicious
individuals. For true security,  the checksum value should be compared
with a printed list of checksums provided by the electronic publisher.




## Analytic Information ##

<a name ="collection"></a>

<span class="refname">ACO</span> *Collection designation*. This is a free-form text record
that can be used to identify a collection,  set, or group of related
works,  such as works appearing in a compendium or anthology. E.g. Norton
Scores,  Smithsonian Collection, Jones Anthology.

<a name ="form designation"></a>

<span class="refname">AFR</span> *Form designation*. This is a free-form text record that can
be used to identify the form (if appropriate) of the work. E.g. fuga, 
sonata-allegro,  passacaglia, rounded binary, rondo.

<a name ="genre designation"></a>

<span class="refname">AGN</span> *Genre designation*. This is a free-form text record that
can be used to identify the genre of the work. E.g. opera,  string
quartet,  barbershop quartet.

<a name ="style,  period, or type of work designation"></a>

<span class="refname">AST</span> *Style,  period, or type of work designation*. This is a
free-form text record that can be used to characterize the style, 
period,  or type of work. This reference can include any term or terms
deemed appropriate by the producer of the document. Designations might
include keywords or keyphrases such as: Baroque,  bebop, Ecole Notre
Dame,  minimalist, serial, reggae, slendro, heterophony, etc.

<a name ="mode classification"></a>

<span class="refname">AMD</span> *Mode Classification*. A combined numerical/name system for
mode identification \-- used especially for medieval monophonic and
later polyphonic works. Modes are indicated by numbers from 1 to 12, 
followed by a semicolon,  followed by the corresponding written name
(with an initial upper-case character). Permissible mode numbers and
names are:

>   ----- ----------------
>   1;    Dorian
>   2;    Hypodorian
>   3;    Phyrgian
>   4;    Hypophyrgian
>   5;    Lydian
>   6;    Hypolydian
>   7;    Mixolydian
>   8;    Hypomixolydian
>   9;    Ionian

>   11;   Aeolian
>   12;   Hypoaeolian
>   ----- ----------------
>
Other non-standard mode names can be used at the discretion of the
electronic editor.

<a name ="metric classification"></a>

<span class="refname">AMT</span> *Metric Classification*. Meters for a file may be classified
as one of the following eight categories: `simple duple`, 
`simple triple`,  `simple quadruple`, `compound duple`,
`compound triple`,  `compound quadruple`, `irregular`, or `various`.

<a name ="instrumentation"></a>

<span class="refname">AIN</span> [**Instrumentation.**](guide.append2.html) This reference is
used to list all of the instruments (including voice) used in the work.
Instruments should be encoded using the abbreviations specified by the
`*I` tandem interpretation described in Appendix II. Instrument codes
must appear in alphabetical order separated by spaces. (Note that
alphabetical ordering is essential in order to facilitate searches for
specific combinations or subsets of instruments using the **grep**
command.) E.g.

> ` !!!AIN: clars corno fagot flt oboe`

An optional part count for each instrument code can be prefixed by
a space before each instrument code, such as this example for a string
quartet:

> ` !!!AIN: 1 cello 1 viola 2 violn`

<a name ="region designation"></a>

<span class="refname">ARE</span> *Geographical region of origin*. This reference identifies
the geographical location from which the work originates. Location
designations are encoded using the local language. The location begins
with the continent designation,  and becomes successively more refined.
If the information is available,  refinement can continue to suburban
district or even street address.

> ` !!!ARE: Europa,  Mitteleuropa, Deutschland, Wuerttemberg, Sindelfingen  !!!ARE: America, North America, United States of America, Ohio, Columbus`

<a name ="location designation"></a>

<span class="refname">ARL</span> *Geographical location of origin*. Like the ARE record,  this
reference record identifies the geographical location from which a work
originates. Location designations are encoded using latitude and
longitude values \-- suitable for creating maps. The first numerical
value indicates latitude (positive values indicating North,  negative
values indicating South). The second numerical value indicates longitude
(positive values only,  indicating distance East from the central
meridian). A slash separates the latitude and longitude values. A series
of trailing characters is used to indicate the degree of accuracy of the
location information: % (continent),  @ (country), \# (province or
state),  : (town or village). For large regions such as countries or
provinces,  the geographical center of the region is used.

> ` !!!ARL: 51.5/10.5@`




## Historical and Background Information ##

<a name ="aural_history"></a>

<span class="refname">HAO</span> *Aural History*. This is a free-form text record used to
relay any story or stories about the origin,  purpose or background of
the work. This reference record is especially useful in
ethnomusicological materials,  where a particular story accompanies a
song. The story may be encoded using several successive HAO records.

<a name ="text_translation"></a>

<span class="refname">HTX</span> *Free-form Translation of Vocal Text*. This is a free-form
text record used to relay a non-literal translation of a vocal text.
This reference record is again especially useful in ethnomusicological
materials.




## Representation Information ##

<a name ="RLN"></a>

<span class="refname">RLN</span> *ASCII language setting*. This reference identifies the
\"language\" code in which the file was encoded. This is applicable only
to computer platforms which provide \"extended ASCII\" text capabilities
(e.g. Danish or Spanish characters).

<a name ="RDF"></a>

<span class="refname">RDF</span> *User-defined signifiers*. All Humdrum representations
provide some signifiers (ASCII characters) that remain undefined. Users
are free to use these undefined signifiers as they choose. When
undefined signifiers appear in a given document,  the
<span class="refname">RDF\*\**interp*</span> code should be used to specify what the
signifiers denote. Notice that the code RDF is followed by the name of
the interpretation to which the signifier definition applies. In the
following example,  the letters \"X\" and \"x\" symbols that are defined
within a hypothetical \*\*piano representation. E.g.

> ` !!!RDF**piano: X=hands cross,  left over right  !!!RDF**piano: x=hands cross, right over left`

<a name ="RDT"></a>

<span class="refname">RDT</span> *Date encoded*. This reference uses the Humdrum
[`**date`](representations/date.rep.html) format to identify the date(s)
when the document was encoded.

<a name ="RNB"></a>

<span class="refname">RNB</span> *Representation note*. This reference provides a free-format
text that conveys some document-specific note related to matters of
representation.

<a name ="RWG"></a>

<span class="refname">RWG</span> *Representation warning*. This reference may be used to
encode explicit warnings concerning the encoded material.

## Electronic Citation ##


Electronic editions of music might be cited in printed or other
documents by including the following information. The \"author\" (e.g.
[<span class="refname">COM</span>](#composer)),  the \"title\" \-- either original title
([<span class="refname">OTL</span>](#OTL)) or translated title (e.g. [<span class="refname">XEN</span>](#XEN)).
The editor ([<span class="refname">EED</span>](#electronic%20editor)),  publisher
([<span class="refname">YEP</span>](#publisher%20of%20electronic%20edition)),  date of
publication and copyright owner
([<span class="refname">YEC</span>](#date%20and%20owner%20of%20electronic%20copyright)),  and
electronic version ([<span class="refname">EEV</span>](#electronic%20edition%20version)),  In
addition,  a full citation ought to include the validation checksum
([<span class="refname">VTS</span>](#checksum%20validation%20number)). This number will allow
others to verify that a particular electronic document is precisely the
one cited. A sample electronic citation might be:

> Franz Liszt,  Hungarian Rhapsody No. 8 in F-sharp minor (solo piano).\
> Amsterdam: Rijkaard Software Publishers,  1994; H.
> Vo\\o\'r\\(hc\'i\\o\'s\\(hc\'ek (Ed.), \
> Electronic edition version 2.1,  checksum 891678772.

In Humdrum files it does not matter where reference records appear.
Since it is common for users to inspect the beginning of a file in order
to check whether the file is being properly processed,  the number of
reference records at the beginning of the file should be kept to a
minimum. A good habit is to place the composer,  title of the work, and
copyright records at the beginning of the file,  and to relegate all
other reference records to the end of the file.
