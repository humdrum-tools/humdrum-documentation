<P>
For Music 824 you will either be using the Hughes Lab (Hughes Rm. 111)
or the Cognitive and Systematic Musicology Lab (Mershon Rm. 503).
</P>

<H4>Hughes Lab Start-up</H4>

<P>
The Humdrum Toolkit is installed on the computers in the first
two rows in the Hughes Rm. 111 laboratory.
In order to log-in, invoke a web browser and type your
Ohio State University <i>user-name</i> and <i>password</i>.
A small pop-up "log-out" window will appear.
When you finish your session, you must remember to click on
the "log-out" button in this window.
If you accidentally close this window, you will find a "log-out"
icon on the Apple "dock" in the lower part of the screen.
</P>

<P>
In order to use the Humdrum Toolkit, you will need a "terminal."
You can start up a terminal by using the file "finder:"
select "Applications," then "utilities."
Scroll down until you find "terminal" and double-click.
You can increase or decrease the size of your terminal
by typing Command (apple key) and the plus sign (+) at the
same time.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>CSML Lab Start-up (in Mershon 503)</H4>

<P>
When starting the course you will be provided with a <B>userid (username)</B>
on the Cognitive and Systematic Musicology Lab computer network.  This is a different account from your University account.
The computers are located on the OSU campus in
<A HREF="../Mershon.location1.html">Mershon Room 503</A>.</P>
<P>
Within the
<A HREF="../CSM_lab.html">CSM Lab</A>,
the Humdrum Toolkit is available on all of the machines,
including the Macintosh and Windows machines. <strong>[As of Fall 2008, Humdrum is not yet available on the Intel Macintoshes (valence and frisson).]</strong></P>

<P>
<B>Logging-In.</B>
Type your <I>CSML userid</I>.
When prompted, type your <I>password</I>.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<h4>CSML Lab Start-up (remotely)</h4>
<p>The computers can also be remotely accessed over the internet. You don't access humdrum through the website. You need to use an <em>SSH client</em> application to connect to the command line (the &quot;shell&quot;) on a CSML machine.</p>
<p>Putty is a good client for Windows:<br>
  <a href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/</a></p>
<p>For OS X, it's easiest to use the built-in ssh client:</p>
<ol>
  <li>In the <strong>Finder</strong>, from the <strong>Go</strong> menu, select the <strong>Utilities</strong> item to open the <strong>Utilities</strong> folder.</li>
  <li>In the <strong>Utilities</strong> folder, run <strong>Terminal</strong>,</li>
  <li>At the command prompt in <strong>Terminal</strong>, enter<br>
    <strong>ssh csml.som.ohio-state.edu</strong></li>
  <li>The first time you connect, you will need to accept a cryptographic key</li>
  <li>When prompted, enter your <em>CSML userid</em> and <em>password</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Next Steps</h4>
<P>
Useful information regarding UNIX can be found at innumerable web sites. See <a href="unix.html">our cheatsheet</a> for places to start.</P>
<P>
Once you are comfortable with logging-in, begin working on the
