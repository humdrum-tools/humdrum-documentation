<P>
Several questions in this assignment require an understanding
of how the command shell interprets special characters like
the octothorpe (#), apostrophe ('), and hyphen (-).
Without this understanding, users are apt to find the shell's
behavior confusing.
For example, in searching for **kern staccato markings,
a common approach might be to try the following command:

<blockquote>
<big><code><b>grep ' syrinx</b></code></big>
</blockquote>

Unfortunately, the command interpreter will respond by
generating a secondary prompt (">"):

<blockquote>
<big><code><b>grep ' syrinx
<br>
></b></code></big>
</blockquote>
</P>
At this point, the shell is actually waiting for you
to finish typing the command.
What is going on?
<P>
Several characters, including
the apostrophe ('), have a special meaning to the shell command interpreter.
The shell treats the apostrophe as a way of quoting material
that the user wants treated as a single object.
Consequently, apostrophies normally appear in pairs -- beginning
and ending the quoted material.
The reason why the shell outputs a secondary prompt (">") is
because it is expecting a matching apostrophe.
You can get out of this situation by either typing a "closing"
apostrophe, or by typing CONTROL-C -- which will cause the
shell to ignore the current command.
</P>
<P>
In order to understand what is going on, it is important to read
the documentation about the shell interpreter.

can be found in the <i>Humdrum User Guide</i>.
Now is a good time to read this description.
</P>
<P>
Having read this explanation, it will be clear that
in order to treat the apostrophe literally,
we must escape it using the backslash character:

<blockquote>
<big><code><b>grep \' syrinx</b></code></big>
</blockquote>
