<blockquote>
<P>
Ideally, research should focus on questions of the highest importance.
The conscientious researcher always trys to answer the most
important questions first.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the most important questions cannot always
be answered given our limited resources and limited understanding.
Instead, we tend to focus on answering questions
for which we have the accumen and resources to answer.
Often these questions are not very interesting or compelling.
</P>
<P>
The best research endeavors to connect good "top-down" questions
with good "bottom-up" research resources.
Computer tools such as Humdrum can provide helpful resources for answering
questions about music, but computer software should not dictate our research agendas.
In learning how to use these bottom-up resources,
it is equally important to learn to creative questioning about music.
The purpose of this assignment is to get you
thinking about the larger issues.
</P>
<P>
<ol>
<li>
You have been granted an audience with God.
<br>
You will be allowed to ask her three questions related
to music.
<br>
What questions will you ask?
</ol>
</P>
<P>
Introduce each of your questions with a paragraph
that sets the stage for your question.
You are not allowed to ask `meta-questions' (such as
`what is a good question about music?').
Your submission should be no less than one page in length
and no more than three pages in length.
</P>
