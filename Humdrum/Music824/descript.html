<H3>Course Description:</H3>
<blockquote>
<P>
The use of computers in music research -- emphasizing
the processing of musical information using the Humdrum Toolkit.
</P>
</blockquote>

<H3>Detailed Description:</H3>
<blockquote>
<P>
This 5-credit hour
<A HREF="#Footnote1">[1]</A>
course will be of interest to students
wishing to develop or enhance their research skills in music.
The course is suitable for students interested in any area
of systematic music research -- including historical research,
music analysis, ethnomusicology, music education,
and music perception and cognition.
The course may also be of interest to students in linguistics,
dance, psychology and library or information sciences.
</P>
<P>
The emphasis in this course is on developing practical
expertise in using computers for music research.
The course focuses predominantly on the
<A HREF="http://www.music-cog.ohio-state.edu/Humdrum/index.html">
<B>Humdrum Toolkit</B></A>.
Humdrum provides tools for extracting, transforming,
linking, classifying, contextualizing, comparing,
and analysing music-related information.
Data might be musical scores, piano fingerings,
lute tablatures, phonetic representations of lyrics,
ethnomusicological symbols, psychological measures,
dance notations (such as Laban or Benesh),
or user-defined information.
The Humdrum pattern recognition and similarity tools will
also be covered.
</P>

<P>
In addition, the course will briefly introduce other
research-related software, principally
<i>Sharp-eye</i>
software for scanning musical notation.
Note that roughly 90% of the course will focus on
the Humdrum Toolkit.
</P>

<H3>Course Objectives:</H3>
<blockquote>

<P>
The course objectives include the following:
<ul>
<li>
to expose students to computer-based scripting tools
for pursuing music research
<li>
to alert students to research opportunities provided
by existing computer-based resources
<li>
to develop students' practical research skills
<li>
to stimulate students' research interests and creative thinking
<li>
to encourage research activities and conversation
about research methods.
</ul>
</P>

</blockquote>
<hr>
<H3>Approach:</H3>
<blockquote>

<P>
The course objectives are pursued through weekly readings
and assignments, lecture/demonstrations,
and extensive computer interaction.

<A NAME="Evaluation">
<hr>
<H3>Method of Evaluation:</H3>
<blockquote>

<P>
The final course grade will be based on the following:
</P>

<TABLE ALIGN="CENTER" BGCOLOR="C0C0C0">
<TR><TD>
Weekly Assignments (6 &#215 10%)</TD><TD>60%
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
Essay Assignment</TD><TD>15%
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
Final test</TD><TD>25%
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P>
The purpose of the weekly assignments is to
help student develop practical skills and facility
in computer-based research scripting.
The questions in the assignments cover a wide variety
of concrete tasks.
The purpose the essay assignment is to encourage students
to develop ideas about possible research projects.
The purpose of the final test is to ensure
that students consolidate their skills.
</P>

<P>
Given the potential for disparate backgrounds,
students' prior background is a factor in evaluation.
