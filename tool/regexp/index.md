### COMMAND

<span class="tool">regexp</span> &mdash; interactive regular-expression tester

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## SYNOPSIS ##

` regexp  [inputfile]`

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## DESCRIPTION ##

The <span class="tool">regexp</span> command invokes an interactive pattern-matcher that is
useful for formulating and refining regular expressions. *Regular
expressions* provide a generic means for defining patterns of characters
(see tutorial in Section 6). Innumerable UNIX and Humdrum commands make
use of regular expressions. The <span class="tool">regexp</span> command allows the user to
test interactively various expressions using a sample text. If no sample
text is supplied by the user *(inputfile)* then a short default text is
used.

Once invoked, the user may interactively input a regular expression
followed by a carriage return. The sample text is scanned for
occurrences of the defined regular expression. Any text lines containing
the matched expression are displayed on the screen; <span class="tool">regexp</span> differs
from the UNIX <span class="unix">grep</span> command in that the precise locations of the
matched pattern are explicitly marked. (See EXAMPLES below.) Note that
only the first occurrence of a matching pattern is identified in each
line of text. (This is how most software tools make use of regular
expressions.)

The entire sample text file may be viewed by typing the regular
expression `.*` or by simply typing a carriage return. Viewing the
sample text is helpful in identifying character-strings that are not
identified by a given regular expression.

The <span class="tool">regexp</span> command is terminated by typing an end-of-file marker
(control-D on UNIX; control-Z on DOS or OS/2).

The <span class="tool">regexp</span> command implements the same regular expression features
found in the UNIX <span class="unix">awk</span> command. This includes all so-called
\"extended\" regular expression features with the exception of \\\> and
\\\<.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## OPTIONS ##

The <span class="tool">regexp</span> command provides only a help option:

-------- -------------------------------------------------------
<span class="option">h</span>   displays a help screen summarizing the command syntax
-------- -------------------------------------------------------

Options are specified in the command line.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## EXAMPLES ##

Imagine the case where the sample text file specified in the command
line contains the following three records:

` The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dogs.  Once upon a time, long, long ago ...  It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.`

The following regular expression defines any character string beginning
with the lower-case letter \`b\', followed by zero or one instance of
any single character, followed by a lower-case vowel.

` b.?[aeiou]`

Given this regular expression, the corresponding output would appear as
follows:

` The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dogs.            ^ ^  It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.             ^^`

Notice that only those text lines matching the defined regular
expression are displayed in the output.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## WARNINGS ##

The regular-expression features provided by <span class="tool">regexp</span> depend on the
local UNIX <span class="unix">awk</span> utility &mdash; as accessed via the `AWK_VER` shell
variable. Available features may change depending on the version of
<span class="unix">awk</span> used.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FILES ##

The default text file is ` $HUMDRUM/regexp.txt.`

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## PORTABILITY ##

DOS 2.0 and up, with the MKS Toolkit. OS/2 with the MKS Toolkit. UNIX
systems supporting the *Korn* shell or *Bourne* shell command
interpreters, and revised *awk* (1985).
