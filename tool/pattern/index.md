### COMMAND

<span class="tool">pattern</span> &mdash; exhaustively locate and count user-defined patterns in a
Humdrum input

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## SYNOPSIS ##

` pattern  [-ciy]  -f templatefile  [-s regexp]  [inputfile ...]`

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## DESCRIPTION ##

The <span class="tool">pattern</span> command is used to locate all occurrences of a
user-defined pattern in some Humdrum input. The patterns sought may span
innumerable data records. Occurrences of the pattern are identified in
the output by line number.

The pattern sought must be defined as a separate \"template\" file. The
template file is identified using the <span class="option">f</span> command option.

Pattern templates consist of one or more records. Each record specifies
a standard UNIX regular expression &mdash; followed by an optional
\"record-count metacharacter.\" The input is scanned from beginning to
end, in order to find passages that match the defined template. In the
simplest case, a match is deemed to take place when successive records
in the input stream match the regular expressions given in each of the
corresponding records of the template. However, the number of records in
the matching input need not be the same as the number of records in the
template.

Consider, first, a simple example where the template consists of the
numbers 1, 2, 3 &mdash; each on a separate line:

``

---
1
2
3
---

This template will match inputs such as the following:

``

------
1
112
43.9
------

or even

``

-----------------
0x.=%&1\*
Figure 32
abc(\...32\...)
-----------------

A more circumspect regular expression template might look like this:

``

-------
\^1\$
\^2\$
\^3\$
-------

(The caret (\^) and dollar sign (\$) are regular expression *anchors*
that indicate the beginning of the record and end of the record
respectively.)

Standard regular expression syntax provides three \"counting\"
metacharacters that can be used to specify the number of occurrences of
a given pattern on a single line. The counting metacharacters are + \*
and ?. If *p* is a regular expression pattern, then (*p*)+ will match
one or more consecutive instances of *p.* Similarly, (*p*)\* will match
zero or more consecutive instances of *p,* whereas (*p*)? will match
zero or one instance of *p.* The use of these metacharacters is
illustrated below:

------- -----------------------------------------------------
X+      matches X, XX, XXX, etc.
X\*     matches X, XX, XXX, etc. as well as the null string
X?      matches X or the null string
XX      matches XX
(XX)+   matches XX, XXXX, XXXXXX, etc.
------- -----------------------------------------------------

*Regular expression counting metacharacters*

These metacharacters can be used in conjunction with other regular
expression operators and anchors to specify complex patterns. See
**regexp (6)** for further details.

In the <span class="tool">pattern</span> command, the regular expression counting
metacharacters may *also* be used to specify the *number of successive
records* that match the regular expression. We refer to this use as
\"record-count metacharacters.\" Record-count metacharacters are
specified by following the regular expression with a tab &mdash; followed by
either +, \*, or ?. For example, consider the following <span class="tool">pattern</span>
template: ``

--- ----
X   \+
Y   \*
Z   ?
--- ----

The intervening tab characters are important here. They indicate that
the metacharacters refer to the number of records rather than to the
number of patterns in a given record. The first template record (X+)
will match one or more lines containing the letter X. The second
template record (Y\*) will match zero or more lines containing the
letter Y. The third template record (Z?) will match zero or one line
containing the letter Z. The above template would match an input such as
the following: three successive lines containing the letter X, followed
by eight successive lines containing the letter Y, followed by a single
line containing the letter Z. Similarly, the above template would also
match a one-line input containing the letter X.

Note that the strings + \*, and ?, are recognized by <span class="tool">pattern</span> as
record-count metacharacters *only* if they appear at the end of a
regular expression.

The <span class="tool">pattern</span> command will identify *all* possible matching patterns
beginning at each point in the input. Consider, by way of example, the
following template file (named `template`): ``

--- ----
1   \+
2   \+
3   \+
4   \+
5   \+
--- ----

The following Humdrum input file is named `example1`: ``

--------- ---------
\*\*num   \*\*num
1         1
2         2
3         2
4         3
5         4
5         5
6         6
\*-       \*-
--------- ---------

Given the command:

` pattern -f template example1`

the <span class="tool">pattern</span> command will produce the following output:

` 4 patterns found from line 2 to line 7 of file example1  1 pattern found from line 2 to line 6 of file example1`

The patterns are: 1-2-3-4-5, 1-2-2-3-4-5, 1-2-3-3-4-5, 1-2-3-4-4-5 and
1-2-3-4-5-5. Note that the entire input line is used for matching
purposes. It doesn't matter, for example, whether the number \"2\" is
matched in the left spine or the right spine &mdash; only that the number
\"2\" is present on a given line. This feature is useful for identifying
*Klangfarbenmelodie* and other \"threaded\" or \"diagonal\" patterns
that can be traced between spines. If the user wishes to avoid such
diagonal patterns, individual spines should be extracted separately
before invoking the <span class="tool">pattern</span> command.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## OPTIONS ##

The <span class="tool">pattern</span> command supports the following options:

------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------
<span class="option">c</span>        makes pattern-matching sensitive to comments
<span class="option">h</span>        displays a help screen summarizing the command syntax
<span class="option">i</span>        makes pattern-matching sensitive to interpretations
-s *regexp*   skip (ignore) data records containing the defined regular expression
<span class="option">y</span>        outputs appropriate \`yank\' commands in place of regular output
------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Options are specified in the command line.

By default, the <span class="tool">pattern</span> command is insensitive to the presence or
absence of Humdrum comments and interpretations. Pattern searches may be
made sensitive to occurrences of comments (defined in the template) by
specifying the <span class="option">c</span> option. Similarly, pattern searches may be made
sensitive to occurrences of interpretations by specifying the <span class="option">i</span>
option.

Certain types of data records may be ignored in the pattern-search by
invoking the <span class="option">s</span> (skip) option. This option must be accompanied by a
user-define regular expression. All input data records matching the
regular expression are ignored. This option is useful, for example, in
skipping null data tokens, barlines, marked embellishment tones, or
other types of data.

The <span class="tool">pattern</span> command does not directly implement an \"echo\" option
&mdash; such as provided by the related <span class="tool">patt</span> command. With the <span class="option">y</span>
option, however, <span class="tool">pattern</span> will produce an output suitable for use
with the Humdrum <span class="tool">yank</span> command. This permits the user to extract the
appropriate matching passages from the input.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## EXAMPLES ##

For additional examples pertinent to the <span class="tool">pattern</span> command, refer to
the [**EXAMPLES**](patt.html#EXAMPLES) section in the documentation for
the related <span class="tool">patt</span> command.

Note that in the above example, the extensive capabilities for defining
complex regular expressions have not been used. Refer to **regexp (6)**
for further pertinent information.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## PORTABILITY ##

DOS 2.0 and up, with the MKS Toolkit. OS/2 with the MKS Toolkit. UNIX
systems supporting the *Korn* shell or *Bourne* shell command
interpreters, and revised *awk* (1985).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## WARNINGS ##

If a comment is present in the template pattern, failing to specify the
<span class="option">c</span> option will make pattern matching a logically impossibility.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## NOTE ##

The <span class="tool">pattern</span> command differs from the related <span class="tool">patt</span> command in the
following ways: (1) <span class="tool">patt</span> always produces output conforming to the
Humdrum syntax whereas <span class="tool">pattern</span> never produces Humdrum output. (2)
<span class="tool">patt</span> does not support multi-record \`wild cards\' in the template
file, and so limits the sophistication of the regular expressions. (3)
The <span class="tool">patt</span> command provides \"echo\" and \"tag\" options.
