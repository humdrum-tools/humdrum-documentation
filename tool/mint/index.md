### COMMAND

**mint** -- determine melodic intervals between successive pitches for
Humdrum inputs

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### SYNOPSIS

` mint  [-acde]  [-b regexp]  [-s regexp]  [inputfile]  [ > outputfile.mnt]`

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### DESCRIPTION

The **mint** command determines the distance (interval) between
successive pitches. Output pitch intervals are expressed as a diatonic
interval size plus interval quality; a leading plus or minus sign
indicates whether the interval is ascending or descending. By way of
illustration, **mint** will change a sequence of `**pitch` data tokens
\-- such as *C4, A4, E4* \-- to the interval sequence *+M6, -P4.* Each
pitch-related input spine is transformed to a corresponding `**mint`
output spine.

The **mint** command determines melodic intervals only for pitch tokens
*within* individual spines. Pitch intervals *across* spines are not
determined by **mint.**

No interval is calculated for the first pitch token; initial pitches are
simply echoed in the output \-- appearing in square brackets. These
initial pitches are referred to as *offset* values, since they indicate
the starting value from which subsequent intervals are calculated.
Offset values can prove useful in attempting to reconstruct the input,
but the user may wish to eliminate offset values in subsequent
processing (see below).

The **mint** command is able to handle multiple-stops. Data-flow
interruptions such as the occurrence of barlines can be handled using
the **-s** option. By defining *regular expression* patterns, the user
may select which types of data tokens should be ignored by **mint.**
(See EXAMPLES below.)

Note that the output spine generated by **mint** preserves the same
record-type structure as the input, and so may readily be pasted with
the input file using the Humdrum [**assemble**](assemble.html) command.

The **mint** command is able to accept any of the pitch-related
representations listed below. For descriptions of the various input
representations refer to Section 2 *(Representation Reference)* of this
reference manual.

It is recommended that output files produced using the **mint** command
should be given names with the distinguishing \`.mnt\' extension.

### OPTIONS

The **mint** command provides the following options:

>   ------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
>   **-a**        output absolute pitch interval without distinguishing ascending/descending
>   -b *regexp*   break; do not calculate difference for tokens matching *regexp*;
>                 restart interval calculations with next pitch token
>   **-c**        output compound intervals as non-compound intervals
>   **-d**        output diatonic interval size only, without the interval quality
>   **-e**        used only with **-s** option; echo skipped data tokens rather than
>                 outputting null tokens
>   **-h**        displays a help screen summarizing the command syntax
>   -s *regexp*   skip; completely ignore tokens matching *regexp*; output null
>                 token(s) instead
>   ------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
>
Options are specified in the command line.

By default, **mint** distinguishes ascending and descending intervals by
prepending a plus or minus sign. If the **-a** option is invoked, then
only unsigned (absolute) intervals are output.

The \"skip\" function takes precedence over the \"break\" function, so
input strings matching both the skip (-s) and break (-b) regular
expressions cause a skip rather than a break.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### EXAMPLES

The various aspects of the **mint** command are best illustrated using a
set of examples. Consider the following input: ``

>   ----------
>   \*\*kern
>   =1
>   8c
>   8g
>   4.b-
>   .
>   8e
>   =2
>   4f
>   8r
>   8C
>   4FF
>   =3
>   \*-
>   ----------
>
Using the default invocation, the **mint** command transforms the above
input as follows: ``

>   ----------
>   \*\*mint
>   =1
>   \[c\]
>   +P5
>   +m3
>   .
>   -d5
>   =2
>   +m2
>   -P11
>   -P5
>   =3
>   \*-
>   ----------
>
The leading or \"offset\" pitch \`c\' has been echoed in square brackets
in the third record. This represents the initial pitch from which
subsequent pitch distances are measured. This offset value reflects the
type of input given to **mint,** thus if the input format is ` **kern`
the offset pitch will be recorded in the same representation. Note that
for absolute pitch units: \`c\' (`**kern`) equals \`C4\' (`**pitch`)
equals \`do4\' (`**solfg`) equals \`C4\' (`**Tonh`).

The subsequent output value (+P5) indicates a melodic interval of an
ascending perfect fifth. This is followed by an ascending minor third
(+m3) followed by a descending diminished fifth (-d5).

Notice that the null-token in the sixth record has been echoed.
Null-tokens have no effect on interval calculations and are treated as
though they are non-existent. In addition, **mint** correctly echoes
(and ignores) both rests and kern-like barlines. Note that pitch
intervals spanning a rest continue to be calculated and that intervals
greater than an octave remain as \"compound intervals.\"

Depending on the application, users may wish to suppress the calculation
of intervals across rests. In this case, the **mint** command can be
invoked using the \"break\" (**-b**) option. Consider the command:

> ` mint -b 'r' input > output.mnt`

Each time **mint** encounters a data token that matches the letter \`r\'
it echoes the input token and begins looking for a new offset value.
Applied to the above sample input file, this command produces the
following output: ``

>   ----------
>   \*\*mint
>   =1
>   \[c\]
>   +P5
>   +m3
>   .
>   -d5
>   =2
>   +m2
>   8r
>   \[C\]
>   -P5
>   =3
>   \*-
>   ----------
>
Notice that the descending perfect eleventh spanning the rest has been
eliminated, and a new pitch offset value \`C\' has been echoed in the
corresponding output.

The **-s** (skip) option can be used to allow the user to selectively
identify records that should not be involved in processing. For example,
the command

> ` mint -s '^[^4]+$' input > output.mnt`

will cause any data token not matching the number 4 to be skipped during
processing. Given the sample input, intervals will be calculated only
between quarter-notes and dotted quarter-notes: ``

>   ----------
>   \*\*mint
>   =1
>   8c
>   8g
>   \[b-\]
>   .
>   8e
>   =2
>   -P4
>   8r
>   8C
>   -P15
>   =3
>   \*-
>   ----------
>
Using the skip option, the user may calculate melodic intervals between
pitches in strong metric positions, or pitches that have been marked as
structural tones.

The **mint** command is also able to process numerical data tokens
containing multiple-stops. Consider the following following sample
input: ``

>   -----------
>   \*\*pitch
>   C4
>   B3 D4
>   A3 C4 F4
>   C4
>   C4
>   \*-
>   -----------
>
Notice the presence of the double- and triple-stops in the third and
fourth records. Using the default invocation, the **mint** command
processes this input as follows: ``

>   ---------------------
>   \*\*mint
>   \[C4\]
>   -m2 +M2
>   -M2 (+m2) (-M2) +m3
>   +m3 P1 -P4
>   P1
>   \*-
>   ---------------------
>
The leading or offset value \[C4\] has been echoed in the second record.
(The user might wish to eliminate such offset values via the
[**humsed**](humsed.html) command; see below.) The third record in both
the input and output contain double-stops. In the output, the first
value of the double-stop (-m2) represents the pitch interval between C4
and B3. The second value in the double-stop (M2) represents the
difference between C4 and D4. In short, **mint** traces both possible
difference \"paths.\"

In processing successive multiple-stops **mint** does not calculate all
of the possible permutations. For example, in the case of two
consecutive triple-stops, **mint** will calculate three intervals
corresponding to the first notes in both triple-stops, the second notes,
and the third notes.

Where the number of multiple-stops changes, **mint** operates under some
special conventions. Consider, for example, the case of a double-stop
followed by a triple-stop: the pitches P+Q followed by X+Y+Z. All of the
possible (interval) differences might be enumerated as follows: X-P,
Y-P, Z-P, X-Q, Y-Q and Z-Q. **Mint** first calculates the \"outer\"
interval distances (X-P and Z-Q). It then calculates a permuted set of
\"inner\" intervals (Y-P and Y-Q). The remaining intervals are
considered unlikely or implausible and are not calculated by **mint.**

In the above example, moving from the double-stop to the triple stop
between records three and four generates two \"outer\" interval
distances (B3 to A3 -\> -M2; D4 to F4 -\> +m3), as well as the permuted
\"inner\" intervals (B3 to C4 -\> +m2; D4 to C4 -\> -M2). Both the
resulting inner intervals are printed in parentheses. A similar process
occurs when moving from records four to five. Three intervals may be
traced from the 3 initial pitches to the subsequent single pitch.

Depending on the goal, the presence of the parentheses makes it easy for
the user to eliminate the inner intervals using the Humdrum
stream-editor [**humsed.**](humsed.html) For example, the command

> ` humsed 's/([^)]*) //g' input > output`

can be used to eliminate inner intervals. Alternatively, the command

> ` humsed 's/[()]//g' input > output`

can be used to eliminate the parentheses surrounding the inner
intervals. Offset values can be transformed to null-tokens using the
command

> ` humsed 's/\\[[^]]*\\]/./g' input > output`

records containing offset values can be eliminated using the command

> ` humsed '/\\[.*\\]/d' input > output`

One final example illustrates how several spines can be processed
concurrently by **mint.** ``

The following command invokes the **-a** and **-d** options. Indications
of the direction of interval movement (ascending/descending) have been
removed, and the diatonic interval sizes are output without the
associated interval qualities (major/minor/perfect/diminished,
augmented).

> ` mint -a -d input | humsed 's/\\[[^\\t]*\\]/./g' > output`

Notice in the corresponding output that the initial offset pitches have
been changed to a null tokens (due to the **humsed** command). ``
