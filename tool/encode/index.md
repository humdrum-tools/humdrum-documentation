### COMMAND

<span class="tool">encode</span> -- interactive Humdrum encoding from MIDI input

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## SYNOPSIS ##

` encode [-r controlfile.rc] [editfile]`

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## DESCRIPTION ##

The <span class="tool">encode</span> command provides an interactive editor for capturing
Humdrum data from a MIDI input device. The operation of <span class="tool">encode</span> can
be tailored by the user to generate a wide range of Humdrum
representations &mdash; including representations designed by the user.

The <span class="tool">encode</span> command is limited to encoding information one spine at a
time. A typical use of <span class="tool">encode</span> might be to encode individual musical
\"parts\" or \"voices\" in a representation such as <span class="rep">kern</span>; the user
might then use the Humdrum <span class="tool">timebase</span> and <span class="tool">assemble</span> commands to
construct a full score from the encoded parts. The user must have access
to an appropriate MIDI controller connected via a Roland MPU-401 (or
compatible) MIDI controller card. Currently, <span class="tool">encode</span> is available
only for IBM PC or compatible hardware running under the DOS operating
system.

The <span class="tool">encode</span> command implements a full-screen interactive text editor
&mdash; similar to the <span class="unix">vi</span> text editor. When invoked, the screen is
divided into three display regions: a *status window,* a *command
window,* and a larger *text window.* The *status window* displays
various pieces of information, including the name of the file being
edited, the current size of the file (in bytes), the run-control (`.rc`)
file used to configure the editor, the number of beats per measure, the
output signifier assigned to each beat, the current metronome rate, and
mode. The *command window* is used to construct and execute
general-purpose commands. The *text window* is used to display and edit
the encoded Humdrum text.

The editor has four modes of operation: *edit mode,* *input mode,* *MIDI
input mode,* and *command mode.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## EDIT MODE ##

When <span class="tool">encode</span> is first invoked, the editor is placed in *edit mode.*
If an edit-file has been specified in the command-line, then the
beginning of any existing text is displayed in the text window. Edit
mode allows the user to move to particular locations in the text and
execute certain types of text manipulation instructions. Movement
through the text can be achieved by either scrolling the display, or by
relative cursor motions within the text window. The cursor position is
indicated by a pulsing underscore character.

Four scrolling commands are available. **Control-F** is used to scroll
forward in the document by one page. **Control-B** is used to scroll
backward by one page. **Control-D** is used to scroll down by half a
page. **Control-U** is used to scroll up by half a page. The
**page-down** and **page-up** keys can be used instead of CTRL-F and
CTRL-B respectively. If any of these commands is preceded by a typed
*number,* then the action is repeated *number* times. Hence `5` will
cause the display to advance five pages.

Movement to specific line numbers can be achieved using the upper-case
\`**G**\' command preceded by the desired line number. If no line number
is specified, the **G** command causes the cursor to be moved to the end
of the file.

Vertical motions of the cursor relative to the displayed text can be
controlled by a variety of means. The up and down cursor-control keys
move the cursor up one line or down one line respectively.
Alternatively, the lower-case letters \`**k**\' and \`**j**\' may be
used for up and down movements &mdash; as in the <span class="unix">vi</span> text editor. If the
cursor is at the bottom or top of the screen, cursor movement down or up
a line (respectively) will cause the screen to scroll one line as
needed. The carriage return or **ENTER** key will cause the cursor to
move to the beginning of the next line. Once again, if any of these
commands is preceded by a typed *number,* then the action is repeated
*number* times.

The upper-case letter \`**H**\' positions the cursor at the highest line
displayed on the screen, whereas the upper-case letter \`**L**\'
positions the cursor at the lowest line displayed on the current screen.
Alternatively, the \`**home**\' and \`**end**\' keys can be used to move
the cursor to the top and bottom respectively. The upper-case letter
\`**M**\' positions the cursor in the middle of the current screen. In
all of these commands, the cursor is positioned at the horizontal
beginning of the appropriate line.

Horizontal motions of the cursor within a line can be carried out using
the left (**\<-**) and right (**-\>**) arrow keys. Alternatively, the
lower-case \`**h**\' and \`**l**\' keys can be used as aliases for the
left and right cursor motions &mdash; as in the <span class="unix">vi</span> text editor. The
**space** bar can also be used to move the cursor to the right. The
dollar sign (**\$**) causes the cursor to move to the end of the current
line. The number zero (**0**) or the caret (**\^**) causes the cursor to
move to the beginning of the current line.

Horizontal cursor movements may also be defined by context. Where
multiple data tokens are encoded on a single line, the \`**w**\' command
causes the cursor to move forward word-by-word, whereas the \`**b**\'
command causes backward movement word-by-word. A *word* is defined as
any character string separated by spaces (or by new lines). In both the
\`**w**\' and \`**b**\' commands the cursor is placed at the beginning
of the appropriate word.

Three forms of simple text deletions are possible in *edit mode.* The
character corresponding to the current cursor position can be deleted by
typing the lower-case letter \`**x**\'. The character immediately before
the current cursor position can be deleted by typing the upper-case
letter \`**X**\'. The lower-case letter \`**d**\' will cause the current
line to be deleted; line deletions may also be achieved by typing the
\`**Del**\' key. Preceding any of these commands by a typed *number*
causes the action to be repeated *number* times. The most recent
deletion can be restored or \"undone\" by typing the lower-case letter
\`**u**\'.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## INPUT MODE ##

The *input mode* allows the manual inputting of typed characters into
the text file. This mode is invoked from the *edit mode* by typing
either \`**a**\', \`**i**\', \`**o**\', or \`**O**\'. When any of these
commands is invoked, the cursor increases in size and the status window
reports the new mode. Typing the letter \`**i**\' will cause all
subsequently typed material to be *inserted* immediately prior to the
current cursor position. Typing the letter \`**a**\' will cause all
subsequently typed material to be *appended* following the current
cursor position. This can also be achieved by typing the \`**Ins**\' or
\`**INSERT**\' key. Typing the letter \`**o**\' will cause a new line to
be *opened* following the current line; subsequently typed material will
begin on this new line. Typing the upper-case letter \`**O**\' will
cause a new line to be opened immediately *prior* to the current line.

Once the input mode is invoked, typed ASCII characters will be added at
the current cursor position until the ESCape or TAB key is pressed.
Pressing ESCape or TAB will return <span class="tool">encode</span> to the *edit mode.* Tabs
are explicitly forbidden as input in order to reduce the possibility of
creating text that does not conform to the Humdrum syntax.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## MIDI INPUT MODE ##

The most characteristic feature of <span class="tool">encode</span> is the *MIDI input mode.*
The MIDI input mode can be invoked from *edit mode* by typing either of
the upper-case letters \`**A**\' or \`**I**\'. The letter \`**I**\' will
cause all subsequent MIDI-driven input to be *inserted* immediately
prior to the current line. The letter \`**A**\' will cause all
subsequent MIDI-driven input to be *appended* immediately following the
current line.

In the *MIDI input mode,* data is entered into the current document
according to user-defined mappings between *MIDI events* (such as caused
by playing on a MIDI keyboard) and ASCII character strings. Predefined
mappings are specified in a *run-time control* (`.rc`) file. When the
<span class="tool">encode</span> command is invoked, it must have access to a` .rc` file
containing configuration information. The user can identify a
specific` .rc` file on the command line via the <span class="option">r</span> option (see
[OPTIONS](#OPTIONS)). Alternatively, <span class="tool">encode</span> will seek a
default` .rc` file (named `encode.rc`) residing in the the current
directory, or if absent, in the `$HUMDRUM/etc` directory. The run-time
control file is essential to the operation of <span class="tool">encode</span>, and inability
to locate a ` .rc` file will cause <span class="tool">encode</span> to abort (see discussion
in [OPTIONS](#OPTIONS) below).

The run-control file contains a series of definitions mapping MIDI
events to output strings. Three classes of MIDI events can be mapped:
*key number* (`KEY`), *delta-time* (`DEL`), and *key velocity* (`VEL`).
Normally, a` .rc` file contains a number of definitions for each class
of event, although some events may not appear at all in some` .rc`
files.

By way of example, the run-control instruction:

` KEY 60 middle-C`

assigns the key-on event for MIDI key \#60 to the string `middle-C`.
When in *MIDI input mode,* each key-on event for key \#60 will cause the
string `middle-C` to be prepared for insertion into the text window.
Typically, a number of `KEY` definitions will appear in a given
run-control file &mdash; often one definition for each MIDI key (0 to 127).

A second class of MIDI events is key-down velocity (`VEL`). Key
velocities can range between 0 (low key velocity) and 127 (high key
velocity). Each `VEL` mapping specifies a range of values for which a
given string will be output. By way of example, the following assignment
maps key velocity values between 90 and 127 to a string consisting
merely of the apostrophe (the <span class="rep">kern</span> signifier for a staccato note):

` VEL 90 127 '`

Given this mapping, key-down velocities within the specified range will
cause the apostrophe character to be prepared for insertion into the
text window.

A third class of MIDI events is delta-time (`DEL`). When determing the
\"duration\" of a performed note, the durations of individual
key-presses are confound by the articulation. In general, performing
musicians are less concerned by the *duration* of individual
key-presses, than by the keypress-to-keypress time spans; the elapsed
time between one key-onset and the next key-onset provides a better
estimate of the nominal musical duration of a note than the actual held
duration. The variable `DEL` contains the *difference between successive
key-onset times* &mdash; expressed in MIDI clock ticks. Values of `DEL` may
range from 0 upward. For a tempo of 60 beats per minute, inter-onset
durations of one second correspond to `DEL` values of about 100.

The following sample` .rc` file illustrates a simple run-control file.
Notice that a series of `DEL` ranges have been defined and mapped to
<span class="rep">kern</span>- or <span class="rep">recip</span>-type durations. For example, inter-onset times
lying between 48 and 80 clock ticks generate the output string \``8`\';
values between 113 and 160 generate the string \``4`\' and so on. Notice
that this file restricts the number of possible output \"durations\" to
just five. ``

--------------------
\# Sample .rc file
KEY 60 c
KEY 62 d
KEY 64 e
KEY 65 f
KEY 67 g
KEY 69 a
KEY 71 b
KEY 72 cc
DEL 48 80 8
DEL 81 112 8.
DEL\* 113 160 4
DEL 161 224 4.
DEL 225 320 2
VEL 90 127 \'
ORDER DEL KEY VEL
--------------------

Any records in the run-control file beginning with a **\#** character
are treated as comments. Empty lines are ignored.

The effect of the above run-control file can be illustrated by example.
Imagine that <span class="tool">encode</span> received two key-on events (key \#60 followed by
key \#62), where the first key exhibited a velocity value of 94 and the
inter-onset time (`DEL`) was 100. The first key (\#60) would be mapped
to the string \``c`\'; the delta-time would be mapped to the string
\``8.`\'; and the key-velocity (`VEL`) would be mapped to the
apostrophe. At the moment of the key-onset for key \#62, these three
strings would be amalgamated according to the `ORDER` instruction (`DEL`
first, `KEY` second, and `VEL` third) &mdash; producing the output string:
`8.c'`

Notice that <span class="tool">encode</span> outputs assembled strings only when the *next*
key-on event occurs. This means that the text display is always one
\"note\" behind the performer. Note that if musical durations are based
on key inter-onset times, it is impossible to output a note prior to the
onset of the next note. The last note in a buffer can be flushed by
typing the ESCape key. (The timing of the last note is based on the
`DEL` between key-onset and the moment of pressing ESCape.)

In addition to mapping velocities, inter-onset times, and key numbers,
run-control files can define a number of other attributes. The MIDI
channel number attended to by <span class="tool">encode</span> can be set by the `RECEIVE`
instruction. Any one of 16 channels (1-16) can be selected. A default
channel 1 is assumed if no `RECEIVE` instruction is present in the
run-control file.

The <span class="tool">encode</span> command has a built-in metronome for assisting real-time
encoding. The metronome sends commands to the MIDI instrument generating
metronome tones. Two types of tones are generated &mdash; tones marking each
beat, and tones marking the beginning of each measure. The metronome
rate (in beats per minute) is set by the TEMPO command. The beat is
specified in two ways. The default beat is indicated by the presence of
an asterisk following *one* of the DEL instructions. In the above
example, the signifier \`4\' is assigned to the default beat. Apart from
the default beat, the beat may also be explicitly assigned using the
BEAT instruction. This instruction is followed by a single argument
identifying the output *signifier* intended to coincide with each
metronome beat. For example, `BEAT 4.` would set the beat in the above
example to the dotted quarter, rather than the quarter. Note that the
specified signifier in the BEAT command must correspond to one of the
existing signifiers defined using a DEL instruction.

The following table lists all of the types of instructions permitted in
a run-control file.

---------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------
\# *text*                          unexecutable comment
BEAT *string*                      set beat to DEL whose output signifier is *string*
beat
BUFFER *n text*                    define (potentially multi-line) text buffer \# *in*
(0-9)
DEL *min max string*               key inter-onset times between *min* and *max*
clock ticks cause *string* to be output
KEY *n string*                     MIDI key-on \#*n* causes *string* to be output
METER *n*                          define number of beats per measure as *n*
METRE *n*                          same as METER
MM *on\|off*                       switch metronome *on* or *off*; default is *on*
ORDER *codeword1 codeword2 \...*   define order of string outputs, where codewords are
selected from: BUFFER, DEL, KEY, SRING, VEL
RECEIVE *n*                        define the MIDI channel from which data is
accepted
STRING *n text*                    define string constant \# *in* (0-9)
TEMPO *n*                          set metronome to *n* beats per minute
VEL *min max string*               key-down velocities between *min* and *max*
cause *string* to be output
---------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------

*Definition types for <span class="tool">encode</span>*

The `BUFFER`, `DEL`, `KEY`, `STRING`, and `VEL` instructions can be
repeated multiple times within the `.rc` file. All other instructions
(`BEAT`, `METER`, `MM`, `TEMPO`, `ORDER` and `RECEIVE`) should appear
only once in the `.rc` file. The `BEAT` and `TEMPO` instructions cannot
appear in the `.rc` file until after the default beat (`DEL*`) has been
defined.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## COMMAND MODE ##

The <span class="tool">encode</span> *command mode* allows a number of general-purpose
commands to be executed &mdash; such as editing a specified file, changing a
default mapping, or auditioning the encoded material. The *command mode*
can be invoked from the <span class="tool">encode</span> *edit mode* by typing the colon
character (:).

Each command is formulated in the *command window* and launched by
pressing the ENTER key. After execution, <span class="tool">encode</span> is returned to *edit
mode.*

Most commands consist of a single character; some commands require one
or more parameters.

The \`**w**\' command causes the current text to be written to disk. If
there is currently no active filename, then an error is displayed
indicating that <span class="tool">encode</span> is unable to write a file without knowledge
of the filename. The command \`w *filename*\' will cause the current
contents to be written to the file *filename*. If <span class="tool">encode</span> was invoked
with a specified filename, then that filename is active throughout the
session.

If the user attempts to write to an existing file (that was not
specified when <span class="tool">encode</span> was invoked), then an error message is issued.
Overwriting an existing file can be achieved by appending an exclamation
mark following the write instruction &mdash; as in \`**w! *filename***.\'

The \`**q**\' command causes <span class="tool">encode</span> to terminate. If the current
file has been modified without writing to disk, then a warning will be
displayed and the quit instruction ignored. Appending an exclamation
mark (\`**q!**\') will cause <span class="tool">encode</span> to terminate without saving any
recent modifications.

Note that the *quit* and *write* commands can be combined as a single
instruction &mdash; \`**wq**\'.

The \`**r *filename***\' command causes <span class="tool">encode</span> to read the file
*filename* into the text, beginning at the line following the current
cursor position.

The \`**v**\' command causes <span class="tool">encode</span> to spawn a <span class="unix">vi</span> text editing
session &mdash; importing the current <span class="tool">encode</span> text. The <span class="unix">vi</span> text
editor provides text manipulation capabilities, including searching,
substitution, and macro-instruction facilities not available in
<span class="tool">encode</span>. (Refer to the UNIX <span class="unix">vi</span> reference document for further
information.) When the <span class="unix">vi</span> session is closed, the edited text file is
returned to the <span class="tool">encode</span> session.

The \`**m**\' command invokes a Humdrum pipeline that is suitable for
auditioning text data conforming to either the <span class="rep">kern</span> or <span class="rep">MIDI</span>
representation formats. Specifically, \`**m**\' causes the current text
to be passed to the Humdrum pipeline: `midi -c | perform`. Any <span class="rep">kern</span>
data will be translated to <span class="rep">MIDI</span> data and sent to the `perform`
command. The user can then interactively proof-listen or audition the
encoded data. Refer to the **perform (4)** for information regarding the
types of interactive commands available during proof-listening. The
<span class="tool">perform</span> command is terminated when the end-of-file is reached, or if
the user presses either the ESCape key or the letter \`q\'. In either
case, control is returned to <span class="tool">encode</span>.

The \`**b**\' command is used to read buffer text defined in the` .rc`
file. Up to ten numbered buffers (0-9) can be defined. The command:

` b 1`

will cause any text denoted `BUFFER 1` to be output following the
current cursor position. Use of the upper-case \`**B**\' rather than
\`**b**\' causes the buffer contents to be inserted prior to the current
line rather than following the current line.

Buffer zero (0) has a special status. When the <span class="tool">encode</span> command is
invoked, if the current text is empty (i.e. empty file or no filename
specified), then the contents of `BUFFER 0` are automatically inserted
into the text. This provides a convenient way to import header
information for a newly encoded file.

The \`**rc *filename***\' command causes <span class="tool">encode</span> to use a different
run-control file *filename*. This allows the <span class="tool">encode</span> environment to
be entirely reconfigured without interrupting the encoding session. This
command can prove useful, for example, when the music being encoded
changes key.

The **set** command can be used to define (or redefine) any parameters
permitted in a `.rc` file. For example, the tempo may be changed, the
metronome turned-off, the metronome beat redefined, a string variable
assigned, or a specific key re-mapped, e.g.

` set TEMPO 92  set MM off  set BEAT 4.  set STRING 3 !! Variation No. ...  set KEY 60 C4`

For the `BUFFER` command, **set** defines an *additional* buffer record,
rather than replacing any existing buffer definitions.

Note that run-control keywords, such as `TEMPO`, may be spelled using
either upper-case or lower-case.

Note that due to the small size of the command window, especially long
command lines may wrap around within the window. This wrap-around has no
affect on the command operation.

--------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[]{#OPTIONS}

## OPTIONS ##

The <span class="tool">encode</span> command provides the following options:

-------------- -------------------------------------------------------
<span class="option">h</span>         displays a help screen summarizing the command syntax
-r *file.rc*   invoke using the run-control file *file.rc*
-------------- -------------------------------------------------------

Options are specified in the command line.

The <span class="option">r</span> option permits the user to identify a specific run-control
file to configure the <span class="tool">encode</span> editor. If this option is omitted,
<span class="tool">encode</span> will seek a default run-control file named `encode.rc` in the
current directory, or in the directory `$HUMDRUM/etc` if not present in
the current directory. If the option is specified, <span class="tool">encode</span> will
search the current directory for the specified run-control file. If this
search fails to locate the file, <span class="tool">encode</span> will search `$HUMDRUM/etc`.
If this fails, <span class="tool">encode</span> will treat the input filename as an absolute
file path. If this fails, encode will issue an error message indicating
that it failed to locate the specified run-control file.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FILES ##

A number of predefined `.rc` files are maintained in the `$HUMDRUM/etc`
directory. Exploration is encouraged. The default file is
`$HUMDRUM/etc/encode.rc`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## PORTABILITY ##

DOS 2.0 and up. An appropriate MIDI controller (such as a keyboard
synthesizer) connected via a Roland MPU-401 (or compatible) MIDI
controller card. The `vi` text editor must be available in order to
invoke the \`v\' edit command.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## WARNINGS ##

Unlike the UNIX <span class="unix">vi</span> text editor, only a single \`**d**\' is required
in edit mode to delete a line (rather than two \\fRd\\fR\'s).
Experienced <span class="unix">vi</span> users should be careful when deleting lines.
