### COMMAND

<span class="tool">humsed</span> &mdash; stream editor for Humdrum inputs

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## SYNOPSIS ##

` humsed   [-E]   'sed_instruction[;sed_instruction;...]'   [inputfile ...]   [ > outputfile]  humsed   [-E]   [-f scriptfile]   [inputfile ...]   [ > outputfile]`

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## DESCRIPTION ##

The <span class="tool">humsed</span> command provides a stream-editor for Humdrum data
records. A stream-editor is a non-interactive editor that automatically
processes a given input according to a user-specified set of editing
instructions. Possible editing operations include substitution,
deletion, transliteration, file-read, and file-write. By default the
output is sent to the display, however the output can be routed to a
file using file redirection (\> *outputfile).*

The <span class="tool">humsed</span> command is fashioned after the UNIX <span class="unix">sed</span> stream
editor. In contrast to **sed,** <span class="tool">humsed</span> editing instructions are
applied only to Humdrum data records; Humdrum *interpretations* and
*comments* are not affected by <span class="tool">humsed</span>.

The <span class="tool">humsed</span> command accepts one or more <span class="unix">sed</span> instructions.
Instructions are specified on the command-line within a pair of single
quotes. Where more than one editing instruction is specified, successive
instructions are separated by a semicolon. Alternatively, instructions
may be executed from a *scriptfile* using the <span class="option">f</span> option. If
instructions are provided both on the command-line as well as via a
*scriptfile,* the command line instructions are performed prior to the
*scriptfile* instructions.

Permissible instructions include ` s` for substitution, ` y` for
transliteration, ` d` for deletion, ` i` for insertion, ` a` for append,
` r` for file-read, and ` w` for file-write. Each instruction may be
preceded by an optional *regular expression* that limits the scope of
the editing instruction only to those data records matching the regular
expression. For example, the user may replace all occurrences of \`X\'
with \`Y\' &mdash; provided the signifier \`Z\' also occurs in the same data
record. In the case of the delete ` (d)` instruction, failing to specify
a preceding regular expression will result in the deletion of all data
records in the input.

For further information concerning the syntax and use of <span class="tool">humsed</span>
editing instructions, refer to the documentation for the UNIX <span class="unix">sed</span>
command.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## OPTIONS ##

The <span class="tool">humsed</span> command provides the following options:

----------------- ---------------------------------------------------------
<span class="option">h</span>            displays a help screen summarizing the command syntax
<span class="option">E</span>            invoke Extended Regular Expression syntax
-f *scriptfile*   execute editing instructions from the file *scriptfile*
----------------- ---------------------------------------------------------

Options are specified in the command line.

With the <span class="option">E</span> option, <span class="tool">humsed</span> invokes the \"extended\" regular
expression syntax, rather than the normal or \"basic\" regular
expression syntax. With extended regular expressions, the following
additional operations are supported: one-or-more (+), zero-or-one (?),
logical OR (\|), precedence grouping ( ), and alphanumeric token start
and end anchors \< \>.

Note that not all systems support extended regular expressions for the
<span class="unix">sed</span> command; on such systems the <span class="option">E</span> option for <span class="tool">humsed</span> is
ineffective and may result in an error.

The <span class="option">f</span> options allows the user to specify a *scriptfile* that
contains a set of editing instructions. Instructions in *scriptfile* are
executed after any command-line editing scripts.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## EXAMPLES ##

The following examples illustrate the substitution, transliteration,
deletion, file-read and file-write instruction provided by <span class="tool">humsed</span>.

Simple substitution:

` humsed 's/A/X/g' ragtime`

The above command replaces the upper-case letter A by the upper-case
letter X. Without the ` g` (global) modifier, only the first occurrence
of an \"A\" in each data record would be modified. The use of ` g`
applies the substitution instruction to *all* occurrences in a data
record.

Substitution commands can be preceded by another regular expression that
limits the selection of records that are affected by the substitution.
For example, the following command eliminates all measure numbers in a
` **kern` representation:

` humsed '/=/s/[0-9]*//g' jellyroll`

Rather than simply eliminating all numerical data, the initial regular
expression ` (/=/)` limits the substitution operation to those data
records contain the ` **kern` barline signifier ` (=).`

More complicated substitutions may involve compound (two or more)
instructions. Instructions are separated by a semicolon, and are
executed in succession for each data record. Consider the following
command:

` humsed 's/4[A-G]/8&/g;s/84/8/g' chicago > fastbass`

This command changes all quarter-note pitches (in a ` **kern`
representation) below middle C to eighth-note durations, while leaving
quarter-notes above middle C unchanged. The first substitution
instruction ` (s/4[A-G]/8&/g)` searches for all strings beginning with
the number 4, followed by one of the upper-case letters A to G. It then
prepends the number 8; thus the token 4F will be replaced by 84F. (Note
that the ampersand (&) in the substitution denotes the matched string
found by the target regular expression.) The second substitution
` (s/84/8/g)` replaces the string 84 by the string 8. In short, tokens
such as 4F and 4CC\# will be modified to 8F and 8CC\# respectively &mdash;
whereas tokens such as 2F and 4cc\# will remain unmodified. (Note that
this command is inadequate if 24th notes (thirty-second note triplets)
are present in the input &mdash; since they will be transformed to 28th
notes.)

The transliteration instruction **(y)** provides a short-cut for
multiple single-character substitutions. For example, the following
command replaces A with 0, B with 1, C with 2, etc. for the letters A to
J:

` humsed 'y/ABCDEFGHIJ/0123456789/' dixieland`

Substitutions are organized by mapping each element in the first
character string with the corresponding element in the second string.
The first and second character strings must contain the same number of
characters.

The delete instruction is preceded by a regular expression, followed by
the single letter **d.** The following command deletes all data records
containing the lower-case letter \"r\".

` humsed '/r/d' swing`

The file-write instruction **(w)** provides a way of copying selected
material to a specified output file. Consider the following command:

` humsed '/;/w pauses' bigband`

This command identifies all data records in the file \"bigband\" that
contain a semicolon (the ` **kern` pause signifier) and copies them into
the file \"pauses.\" Recall that <span class="tool">humsed</span> operates only on Humdrum
data records, so the ` w` command will cause only data records to be
outputted. Hence the resulting file \"pauses\" will not be a valid
Humdrum file. (If the user wishes the extracted material to be in a
valid Humdrum format, this could be done using the Humdrum <span class="tool">yank</span>
command:`yank -m ';' 0 bigband > pauses`.)

The <span class="tool">humsed</span> command can also be used to read **(r)** material from a
specified file whenever a certain condition occurs in the input stream.
For example, the following command could be used to search for ` **kern`
pause signifiers (;) and add a global comment indicating the presence of
a pause.

` humsed '/;/r comment' bebop`

&mdash; where the file \"comment\" contains the following global comment:

` !! A pause.`

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## PORTABILITY ##

Any system supporting the UNIX-style <span class="unix">sed</span> command. Note that the
<span class="option">E</span> option is a non-POSIX extension currently supported only by the
MKS toolkit. It is hoped that in the future, other systems will support
extended regular expression syntax for **sed.**

## WARNINGS ##

In the process of modifying text, it is possible to transform
inadvertently Humdrum data records into interpretation records or
comments. Particular caution should be exercised when inserting
exclamation marks or asterisks.

In addition, it is possible to disrupt the spine structure by inserting
or deleting tabs. Substitutions may result in empty lines or extra
spaces that render the file no longer consistent with the Humdrum
syntax.
