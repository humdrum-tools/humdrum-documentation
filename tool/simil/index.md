### COMMAND

<span class="tool">simil</span> -- measure the non-numeric similarity between two
single-spine Humdrum inputs

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## SYNOPSIS ##

` simil  [-nr]  [-x length]  sourcefile  [templatefile]  [ > outputfile.sim]`

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## DESCRIPTION ##

The <span class="tool">simil</span> command measures the degree of similarity between two
single-spine inputs. Similarity measures are calculated by determining
the minimum *edit distance* &mdash; that is, the least amount of editorial
manipulation required to transform the two inputs so that they are
identical. In contrast to the <span class="tool">correl</span> command,
<span class="tool">simil</span> can act on both numeric and non-numeric data, and so can be
used to characterize similarity for any form of Humdrum input.

Two inputs are required by <span class="tool">simil</span> &mdash; the *source* and *template*
inputs. Both inputs must contain single columns of data; multi-column
inputs are forbidden. The *source* input must conform to the Humdrum
syntax, however the *template* should contain only data records.
Comments and interpretations should not appear in the *template.* In
addition, following the initial exclusive interpretation, all comments
and interpretations in the *source* input should be removed.

Depending on the mode of operation, <span class="tool">simil</span> outputs either one or two
spines of continuous information regarding the similarity of the two
inputs. The length of <span class="tool">simil</span>\'s output matches that of the *source*
file.

Two modes of operation are provided by <span class="tool">simil</span>: the *fixed template
mode* and the *variable template mode.* The fixed template mode is
useful for scanning a source input for patterns similar to a given
template. This mode of operation is useful when the user knows in
advance what feature or pattern is being sought. The variable template
mode, by contrast, provides an automated means for discovering common
patterns shared by the template and source inputs.

In the *fixed template mode,* a single output spine is generated, dubbed
<span class="rep">simil</span>. Output similarity values are numbers ranging between zero and
one. These numbers indicate the relative similarity between the source
and template inputs at the current location in the *source* file. Values
near zero indicate great dissimilarity whereas a value of precisely 1.00
indicates that the template and source match exactly at the current
position.

In *fixed template mode,* the entire *template* input is treated as a
single pattern and compared with the *source* input. In this mode, the
template may not be longer than the source input. If the length of the
template is the same as the length of the source input, then only a
single output value is generated &mdash; representing the edit-distance
similarity of the two files. The remaining output is padded by null
tokens. If the template is shorter than the source input, then the
source input is scanned using the template. For each data record in the
source input the edit-distance similarity is measured between the entire
template and a string of corresponding length beginning at the current
point in the source input. Each successive output value indicates the
degree of similarity between the template and source inputs as the
template is shifted along the source input.

In the *variable template mode,* the template input provides a
\"reservoire\" from which multiple templates are derived. Specifically,
the template input is broken-up into a series of (shorter) overlapping
\"subordinate\" templates. The length of each of these subordinate
templates is determined by the <span class="option">x</span> option parameter. For example,
consider a template input consisting of the values: 1, 2, 3, 4 &mdash; each
number appearing on successive lines. With **-x 3**, two subordinate
templates will be generated, each consisting of three data records: 1,
2, 3 and 2, 3, 4. With **-x 2**, three subordinate templates will be
generated, each consisting of two data records: 1, 2; 2, 3; and 3, 4.

Two output spines are generated in the *variable template mode:*
<span class="rep">simil</span> and <span class="rep">simxrf</span>. The <span class="rep">simxrf</span> spine provides cross-reference
information identifying the place in the template input where a
subordinate pattern is highly similar to the current position in the
source file. As each record is encountered in the source input,
<span class="tool">simil</span> scans the list of all possible subordinate templates and
identifies the template with the highest similarity value. This value is
output (in the <span class="rep">simil</span> spine) along with the *line number* in the
original template input where the subordinate template begins. If more
than one subordinate template shows the same similarity value, then the
line numbers for each high-similarity template appear in the <span class="rep">simxrf</span>
spine, separated by commas. Common subordinate patterns will appear
frequently in the <span class="rep">simxrf</span> output.

It is recommended that output files produced using the <span class="tool">simil</span> command
should be given names with the distinguishing \`.sim\' extension.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FURTHER DETAILS ##

The <span class="tool">simil</span> program implements the Damerau-Levenshtein metric for edit
distance (see [REFERENCES](#REFERENCES)). Permissible edit operations
include substitutions and deletions. Each edit action incurs a penalty,
and the cummulative edit-distance penalty determines the similarity.

In the default operation, <span class="tool">simil</span> assigns equivalent edit penalties
(1.0) for deletions and substitutions. However, the user can explicitly
define these penalties.

The <span class="tool">simil</span> command allows the user to define the cost of each edit
operation via an initialization file. The initialization file must be
named `simil.rc` and be located in the current directory or the user's
home directory. Arbitrary costs may be assigned to any of eight edit
operations shown in the following table:

---------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Name Tag   Edit Operation
D1         Delete a nonrepeated token in String 1
D2         Delete a nonrepeated token in String 2
R1         Delete a repeated token in String 1
R2         Delete a repeated token in String 2
S0         Substitute a token that is repeated in neither String 1 nor String 2
S1         Substitute a token that is repeated in String 1 only
S2         Substitute a token that is repeated in String 2 only
S3         Substitute a token that is repeated in String 1 and String 2
---------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------

*Edit operations used by <span class="tool">simil</span>.*

In describing the edit operations, String 1 is the source string and
String 2 is the template string. Notice that there is no overt edit
operation for insertion: an insertion in String 1 is deemed equivalent
to a deletion in String 2. However, different edit penalties may be
defined for deletions from String 1 (D1) compared with deletions from
String 2 (D2). In musical applications defining such asymmetrical
penalties may be important. For example, two inputs may represent a
basic melody and an embellished variant of the melody. Using
asymmetrical penalties allows the user to specify that the deletion of
tones from the embellished version is less costly than deletion of tones
from the basic melody.

Since repetition is a common form of musical variation, <span class="tool">simil</span> allows
the user to distinguish between repeated and non-repeated tokens. A
repeated token is defined as one that is immediately preceded by an
identical token. Thus, in deleting a sequence of identical symbols in
String 1, say, all deletions except the first occurrence are R1
operations, whereas the deletion of the first occurrence is a D1
operation.

Note that the minimum theoretical similarity for any set of penalty
weightings can be determined empirically by providing the <span class="tool">simil</span>
program with source and template strings that share no symbols in
common. For example, the source input may consist entirely of numbers,
whereas the template input consists entirely of alphabetic characters.
In the case where all edit operations are assigned a penalty of +1, the
minimum quantitative similarity between two strings is 0.37.

Some user-defined weightings may give rise to peculiar results &mdash; such
as negative costs &mdash; but <span class="tool">simil</span> does not forbid this. **Simil**
generates warning messages if the weighting seem illogical; for example,
if the cost of R1 is more than that of D1. In addition, <span class="tool">simil</span> will
abort operation if the defined edit penalties transgress the triangular
inequality (see [REFERENCES](#REFERENCES)). The default weighting for
all operations is +1.

Below is a sample initialization file that defines the R1 substitution
has having an edit penalty of 0.7, whereas the R2 substitution is given
a penalty of 0.9. Edit penalties are defined by specifying the
operation, followed by some spaces or tabs, followed by some real
number. Since no other penalties are defined in this file, the remaining
edit operations use the default edit penalty of 1.0. If any operation is
assigned more than one weight, the latest assignment is used. The user
may effectively eliminate a given edit operation by defining an
arbitrarily high edit penalty. ``

## OPTIONS ##

The <span class="tool">simil</span> command provides the following options.

------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<span class="option">n</span>        do not scale similarity measures according to template length
-r            reverse the order of *source* and *template* inputs on the command line;
permits the source file to be entered using the standard input.
-x *length*   invoke *variable template mode*; break-up template file input into subordinate
patterns of length *length*
------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Options are specified in the command line.

Raw edit-distance scores are normally unreliable estimates of
similarity, unless the length of the template is considered. For
example, 3 editing operations constitutes a rather modest change for a
template consisting of 20 elements. However, 3 edit operations is
significant for a template consisting of only 5 elements. In the default
operation, <span class="tool">simil</span> scales the edit-distance scores according to the
length of the comparison template. This ensures that all similarity
values remain between 0 and 1. The <span class="option">n</span> option defeats this scaling
procedure, and outputs the raw similarity scores.

The <span class="option">r</span> option reverses the order of the *source* and *template*
input specifications on the command line. If both inputs are files, this
option is of little use. Where one input is to be typed manually via the
standard input, this option allows the user to specify a template file
as input, and to type the source document manually.

The <span class="option">x</span> option invokes the *variable template mode* discussed above.
The numerical argument given to the <span class="option">x</span> option determines the length
of the subordinate templates drawn from the template file.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## EXAMPLES ##

The following examples illustrate the operation of <span class="tool">simil</span>. Consider
first, the *fixed template mode.* In the following example, the source
input consists of the left-most spine (labelled <span class="rep">foo</span>) and is held in
a file named `source`; the middle column (not Humdrum) consists of the
letters A, B and C, and is held in the file named `template`. The
following command:

` simil source template`

generates the third column (labelled <span class="rep">simil</span>): ``

--------- ----------- -----------
(source   (template   (simil
input)    input)      output)
\*\*foo   A           \*\*simil
X         B           0.51
A         C           1.00
B                     0.51
C                     0.37
D                     0.51
A                     0.72
B                     0.72
B                     0.51
C                     0.51
B                     .
A                     .
\*-                   \*-
--------- ----------- -----------

Each successive value in the output spine is matched with a data token
in the source input file. For example, the second value (1.00) in the
<span class="rep">simil</span> spine arises from an exact match of the (A, B, C) pattern
*beginning* with the second data token in the source input. The second
highest value (0.72) occurs in both the sixth and seventh <span class="rep">simil</span> data
records, indicating that fairly similar sequences occur beginning with
the sixth and seventh data records in the source input. Specifically,
<span class="tool">simil</span> has recognized that the sequence (A, B, B, C) is only one
edit-operation (a deletion) different from the template (A, B, C). In
the ensuing record, <span class="tool">simil</span> has recognized that the sequence (B, B, C)
is only one edit-operation (substitution A/B) different from (A, B, C).
Notice that the final value (0.51) indicates that the edit distance for
(C, B, A) is less like the template. Also notice that the lowest value
(0.37) corresponds to an input pattern (beginning C, D, A) that bears
little resemblance to the template.

If the above input were pitches, it might be argued that *changing* a
pitch is more dissimilar than *repeating* a pitch. In the following
`simil.rc` file, an increased penalty has been assigned for dissimilar
substitution, and decreased penalties have been assigned for repetition.

S0   1.6
S1   0.7
S3   0.7

Repeating the above command with this new `simil.rc` file produces the
following results: ``

--------- ----------- -----------
(source   (template   (simil
input)    input)      output)
\*\*foo   A           \*\*simil
X         B           0.51
A         C           1.00
B                     0.51
C                     0.26
D                     0.51
A                     0.79
B                     0.59
B                     0.51
C                     0.51
B                     .
A                     .
\*-                   \*-
--------- ----------- -----------

Notice that the similarity measure for the pattern (A, B, B, C) has
increased from 0.72 to 0.79, whereas the similarity measure for (B, B,
C) has decreased from 0.72 to 0.59.

Consider now the use of the *variable template mode.* Once again, we
will use the same source and template files. Given the short length of
the template, there is little choice regarding the length of the
subordinate templates. In the following command, a template length of
two elements is specified:

` simil -x 2 source template`

This command produces the following output: ``

----------- ------------
\*\*simil   \*\*simxrf
0.37        1,2
1.00        1
1.00        2
0.37        1,2
0.37        1,2
1.00        1
0.61        1,2
1.00        2
0.61        1
0.61        2
0.61        1
.           .
\*-         \*-
----------- ------------

Only two two-element subordinate patterns are possible given out
template &mdash; (A, B) and (B, C). The first subordinate template begins on
line 1 of the template file, while the second subordinate template
begins on line 2. The <span class="rep">simxrf</span> spine identifies which of the
subordinate patterns is most similar to the source file at the given
input record. The <span class="rep">simil</span> spine identifies the corresponding
similarity measure for the most similar pattern. For example, the second
and third <span class="rep">simil</span> records both report similarity values of 1.00.
However, the first instance is associated with the pattern beginning on
template record 1 (A, B), whereas the second instance is associated with
the pattern (B, C) beginning on template record 2.
