### COMMAND

<span class="tool">scramble</span> -- randomize order of either Humdrum data records or data
tokens

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## SYNOPSIS ##

` scramble   -r   [-s regexp]   [inputfile]  scramble   -t   [-m]   [-s regexp]   [inputfile]`

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## DESCRIPTION ##

The <span class="tool">scramble</span> command can be used to randomize either the order of
Humdrum data records or the arrangement of data tokens within each data
record. The <span class="tool">scramble</span> command is useful for generating control data
when testing contextual relationships between signifiers.

Two modes of operation are supported according to whether the <span class="option">r</span>
(record) or <span class="option">t</span> (token) option is invoked. When the <span class="option">r</span> mode is
selected, the order of data records is randomized. In this mode, each
output record is identical to some input record; only the order of the
output records is changed. When the <span class="option">t</span> mode is selected, the order
of data tokens within each record is randomized. In this mode, the order
of the input records is preserved &mdash; however, data tokens between
concurrent spines are randomly swapped. The <span class="option">t</span> mode will also cause
sub-tokens within multiple stops to be rearranged within the data token.
However, if the <span class="option">m</span> option is concurrently invoked, then sub-tokens
within multiple-stops will be randomly redistributed across all tokens
in the record. The <span class="option">r</span> and <span class="option">t</span> options cannot be invoked
concurrently.

In both modes of operation, Humdrum comments and interpretations remain
unaffected. Comments and interpretations are output intact, and in
precisely the same location (line number) as in the input. Only data
records are affected by <span class="tool">scramble</span>.

Each time <span class="tool">scramble</span> is invoked, a different random ordering is
generated.

Note that when using the <span class="option">r</span> mode, the scrambling process may produce
an output that is no longer syntactically correct Humdrum. With the
<span class="option">r</span> mode, <span class="tool">scramble</span> is guaranteed to produce Humdrum output only
if (1) the input file is bona fide Humdrum, and (2) the number of spines
in the input does not vary.

With the <span class="option">t</span> mode, <span class="tool">scramble</span> will always produce output conforming
to the Humdrum syntax, however it can produce uninterpretable output if
concurrent spines do not contain the same type of data (that is, they
have different exclusive interpretations).

Notice also that reordering data records may destroy data-token links
such as ` **kern` ties.

A skip option (<span class="option">s</span>) permits users to anchor certain data records so
that they are not either repositioned, or their data tokens re-ordered.

## OPTIONS ##

The <span class="tool">scramble</span> command provides the following option:

------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------
<span class="option">h</span>        displays a help screen summarizing the command syntax
<span class="option">m</span>        redistribute subtokens in multiple stops across all tokens in the
record; used in conjunction with <span class="option">t</span> only
<span class="option">r</span>        scramble the order of data records; don't scramble data tokens
-s *regexp*   skip; don't scramble records matching *regexp*;
leave matching records intact, and in the same position
<span class="option">t</span>        scramble data tokens within each record; don't scramble record order
------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Options are specified in the command line. One of either the *record
mode* (<span class="option">r</span>) or *token mode* (<span class="option">t</span>) must be invoked.

## EXAMPLES ##

The use of the <span class="tool">scramble</span> command can be illustrated using the
following input: ``

--------------------- -----------
!! A global comment
!! Another comment
\*\*inter             \*\*inter
\*abcd                \*efgh
=1                    =1
1a 1b                 a
!local                !local
2                     b1 b2 b3
3                     c
=2                    =2
!! A later comment.
4a 4b                 d
=3                    =3
5                     e
\*-                   \*-
--------------------- -----------

When processed using the *record mode,* the command:

` scramble -r -s = inputfile`

might produce the following output: ``

--------------------- -----------
!! A global comment
!! Another comment
\*\*inter             \*\*inter
\*abcd                \*efgh
=1                    =1
3                     c
!local                !local
5                     e
1a 1b                 a
=2                    =2
!! A later comment.
4a 4b                 d
=3                    =3
2                     b1 b2 b3
\*-                   \*-
--------------------- -----------

In this example, notice that the Humdrum comments and interpretations
remain in their original location; only the data records have been
reordered. In addition, data records containing an equals-sign have been
frozen in their original locations.

When processed using the *token mode,* the command:

` scramble -t -m -s = inputfile`

might produce the following output: ``

--------------------- -----------
!! A global comment
!! Another comment
\*\*inter             \*\*inter
\*abcd                \*efgh

1b                    a 1a
!local                !local
b2                    b3 2 b1
c                     3
=2                    =2
!! A later comment.
4a 4b                 d
=3                    =3
5                     e
\*-                   \*-
--------------------- -----------

Notice that a complete scrambling of data tokens within a Humdrum file
cannot be achieved merely by invoking one <span class="tool">scramble</span> mode followed by
the other mode. In order to completely scramble a Humdrum file the user
must extract and scramble the record order for each spine independently,
and then reassemble the scrambled spines into a new file using the
<span class="tool">assemble</span> command.

Note also that where the number of spines changes over the course of the
input file, valid Humdrum output is unlikely. Outputs consistent with
the Humdrum syntax can be ensured by using the **fields -i** command to
chronicle changing numbers of spines in a file, followed by the <span class="tool">yank</span>
command to segregate data blocks containing the same number of spines.
Each such bock can be <span class="tool">scramble</span>d independently and then the blocks
reconnected using the UNIX <span class="unix">cat</span> command. Unnecessary (duplicate)
interpretations can be eliminated using **rid -u.**

## PORTABILITY ##

DOS 2.0 and up, with the MKS Toolkit. OS/2 with the MKS Toolkit. UNIX
systems supporting the *Korn* shell or *Bourne* shell command
interpreters, and revised *awk* (1985).

## WARNINGS ##

If the number of spines changes over the course of the input file, valid
Humdrum output is unlikely when using the <span class="option">r</span> option. Note also that
reordering data records or data tokens will destroy data-token links
such as

Note that the <span class="tool">scramble</span> command cannot be used in pipes. ` **kern`
\"ties.\" Use of the <span class="option">t</span> mode, can produce uninterpretable output
when concurrent spines do not contain the same interpretations.
