### COMMAND

<span class="tool">recode</span> -- recode numeric tokens in selected Humdrum spines

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## SYNOPSIS ##

` recode  -f  reassign-file  -i  '**interpretation'  [-s regexp]  [-x]  [inputfile ...]`

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## DESCRIPTION ##

The <span class="tool">recode</span> command is used to recode numeric components of data
tokens in selected input spines. Typically, <span class="tool">recode</span> is used to
reassign a range of numerical values into a finite set of classes or
categories. For example, <span class="tool">recode</span> could be used to reassign all
numerical values less than zero to the value -1, and to assign all
values greater than or equal to zero to the value +1. A typical use of
<span class="tool">recode</span> might be to reassign melodic intervals (represented in
semitones) to one of five categories: (1) unison \[0 semits\], (2) up
step \[plus 1 or 2 semits\], (3) up leap \[plus 3 or more semits\], (4)
down step \[minus 1 or 2 semits\], (5) down leap \[minus 3 or more
semits\]. Similarly, duration information might be rhythmically
\"justified\" so that all durations near 0.5 seconds are recoded as
precisely 0.5 seconds.

Note that <span class="tool">recode</span> will modify only those input spines matching the
exclusive interpretation specified in the command line.

The manner by which numeric values are reassigned is specified by the
user in a separate *reassignment file.* Reassignment files consist of
one or more reassignment records; each record specifies a *condition*
and a resulting replacement *string.* When the condition is satisfied,
the numerical data is replaced by the associated string. A simple
reassignment file is: ``

----- -------
==0   zero
!=0   other
----- -------

This file contains two reassignment records. *Conditions* are given in
the left column and the associated replacement *strings* are given in
the right column. Conditions and strings are separated by a single tab.
Given the above reassignment, when a numerical value in an input token
is equal to zero, the output replaces the input number by the alphabetic
string \"`zero`.\" The second condition (!= means not-equals) indicates
that if a numerical value not equal to zero is encountered in an input
token, the output replaces the number by the alphabetic string
\"`other`.\"

Permissible relational operators are listed in the following table.

------ -----------------------
==     equals
!=     not equals
\<     less than
\<=    less than or equal
\>     greater than
\>=    greater than or equal
else   default relation
------ -----------------------

*Relational operators for <span class="tool">recode</span>*

Permissible replacement strings include any combination of printable
ASCII characters with the exception of the tab.

Conditions are tested in the order given in the reassignment file. Thus
if a numeric value satisfies more than one condition, only the first
string replacement is made. Consider, for example, the following
reassignment file: ``

------- --------
\<=0    LOW
\>100   HIGH
\>0     MEDIUM
------- --------

In this case, all numeric values are replaced by one of three strings:
` HIGH, MEDIUM,` or ` LOW.` The order of specification is important in
the above file. If the `MEDIUM` condition was specified prior to the
`HIGH` condition, then all values greater than one hundred would be
categorized as `MEDIUM` rather than as `HIGH`.

The *else* relation can be used to specify the default string output for
numeric input values that satisfy none of the preceding conditions in
the reassignment file. If no *else* condition is specified and none of
the other conditions are satisfied, <span class="tool">recode</span> outputs the original
input token without any modification.

Substitutions are made even when a number is embedded in non-numeric
data. For example, given the above reassignment file, an input token
`foo200bar` would be output as `fooHIGHbar`. That is, the numeric
portion of the input string (200) would be deemed to satisfy the
condition (\>100) and so would be replaced by the string (\"HIGH\").

An important property of the <span class="tool">recode</span> command is that string
replacements are limited to the **first** occurrence of numeric data
within each data token. Subsequent numeric data within the token remains
untouched. Thus, using the above reassignment file, the input token
`foo200bar300` would be output as `fooHIGHbar300`.

In the case of multiple-stops (data tokens having two or more parts
separated by spaces), <span class="tool">recode</span> processes the first occurrence of
numeric data for each part of the token. For example, the double-stop
token `foo200 bar300` would be output as `fooHIGH barHIGH`.

The <span class="tool">recode</span> command provides options to identify which data tokens
may be excluded (skipped) in processing **(-s),** plus an option that
suppresses the echoing of unprocessed signifiers in the output **(-x).**
See OPTIONS for further information.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## OPTIONS ##

The <span class="tool">recode</span> command provides the following options:

--------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------
-f *reassign*         use reassignments given in file *reassign*
<span class="option">h</span>                displays a help screen summarizing the command syntax
-i *\'\*\*interp\'*   process only *\*\*interp* spines
-s *regexp*           skip; completely ignore tokens matching *regexp*;
(echo in output only)
<span class="option">x</span>                (exclude) do not echo unprocessed data signifiers in the output
--------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------

Options are specified in the command line.

The user can suppress the echoing of non-numeric data within a token by
specifying the <span class="option">x</span> option on the command line. When this exclude
option is selected, only the replacement strings are output. For
example, given the following reassignment file: ``

------- --------
\<=0    LOW
\>100   HIGH
\>0     MEDIUM
------- --------

The input token ` foo200bar` would be output as `HIGH`. If a data token
contains no numeric component, then the <span class="option">x</span> option causes a null
token to be output.

The <span class="option">x</span> option also suppresses the echoing of unprocessed numerical
components. (Recall that string replacements made by <span class="tool">recode</span> are
limited to the first occurrence of numerica data within a data token.)
For example, with the <span class="option">x</span> option, the input data token ` foo200bar17`
would be output as `HIGH`.

Processing of certain types of data tokens may be avoided by invoking
the <span class="option">s</span> (skip) option. This option must be accompanied by a
user-define regular-expression (see **regexp (6)**). Input data tokens
matching this expression are not processed and are simply echoed in the
output. This option may be useful, for example, in avoiding the
processing of barlines, or other types of data.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## EXAMPLES ##

The operation of the <span class="tool">recode</span> command can be illustrated by referring
to the following hypothetical Humdrum file named `patrie`.

``

---------- ---------
\*\*kern   \*\*abc
16g        0
8.g        00
16g        1
=1         =1
4cc        2.0
4cc        +3.
4ee        4
4ee        -1
=2         =2
4.gg       22.
8ee        1.1
8.cc       .1
16cc       x1X
8.ee       x1x2x
16cc       1 2
=3         =3
4a         .
4r         r
\*-        \*-
---------- ---------

Consider also the following \"reassignment\" file, named `reassign`. ``

------ ----------
==0    zero
==1    one
==2    two
\<0    negative
\<=3   \<=3
\>4    \>4
else   ???
------ ----------

The command:

` recode -s = -i '**abc' -f reassign patrie`

would produce the following output: ``

---------- ----------
\*\*kern   \*\*abc
16g        zero
8.g        zero
16g        one
=1         =1
4cc        two
4cc        \<=3
4ee        ???
4ee        negative
=2         =2
4.gg       \>4
8ee        \<=3
8.cc       \<=3
16cc       xoneX
8.ee       xonex2x
16cc       one two
=3         =3
4a         .
4r         r
\*-        \*-
---------- ----------

Notice the following: (1) the measure numbers `1` and `2` have remained
unchanged due to the skip option `-s =`, (2) the input `x1X` has been
replaced by the output string ` xoneX` (non-numeric data remain in the
same relative position), (3) the input `x1x2x` has been replaced by the
output string ` xonex2x` (only the first numerical value in each token
is modified), (4) the double-stop input `1 2` has been replaced by the
output string ` one two,` and (5) both the null token (.) and the
non-numeric token (`r`) have been echoed in the input unchanged.

Note that with the <span class="option">x</span> option, all of the non-numeric signifiers in
` **abc` spine would be suppressed in the output. The single non-numeric
token (`r`) would be output as a null token.
