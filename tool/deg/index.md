### COMMAND

<span class="tool">deg</span> &mdash; translate selected Humdrum pitch-related representations to
relative scale degree (<span class="rep">deg</span>)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## SYNOPSIS ##

` deg  [-k|K key] [-tx]  [inputfile ...]  [> outputfile.deg]`

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## DESCRIPTION ##

The <span class="tool">deg</span> command transforms various pitch-related inputs to the
corresponding scale degree. The command outputs one or more Humdrum
<span class="rep">deg</span> spines &mdash; where scale degrees are indicated by the numbers 1
(tonic) to 7 (leading tone). Scale degree information can be determined
only with reference to some prevailing key. For example, the pitch C4 is
the tonic (1) in the key of C major, but the submediant (6) in the key
of E minor. The <span class="tool">deg</span> command expects a tandem interpretation
indicating the key of the input passage; <span class="tool">deg</span> will adapt to specified
changes of key within an input. If no key information is provided prior
to the first pitch-related data, <span class="tool">deg</span> issues an error message and
terminates.

The <span class="tool">deg</span> command differs from the (related) <span class="tool">degree</span>
command in that it outputs *relative* (rather than *absolute)*
pitch-height information. Upward pitch motions are indicated by the
caret (\^), whereas downward pitch motions are indicated by the
lower-case letter \`v\'. Hence, the token \`1\' followed by \`\^5\'
means that the ensuing dominant pitch is above rather than below the
preceding tonic pitch. No absolute pitch-height information is
represented. As in the case of [<span class="tool">degree</span>,](degree.html) plus and minus
signs indicate whether a pitch has been chromatically raised or lowered.
For example, the pitch A-flat is designated \`6-\' in the key of C
major, but \`6\' in the key of C minor. The harmonic minor scale is
assumed for all minor keys. Thus, B-flat is considered a \"lowered\"
seventh degree in C minor, whereas B natural is considered the
\"normal\" (rather than \"raised\") seventh degree. For some
applications, this interpretation of the minor-scale seventh degree may
cause difficulties.

The <span class="tool">deg</span> command is able to translate any of the pitch-related
representations listed below. For descriptions of the various input
representations (including <span class="rep">deg</span>) refer to Section 2 *(Representation
Reference)* of this reference manual.

It is recommended that output files produced using the <span class="tool">deg</span> command
should be given names with the distinguishing \`.deg\' extension.

## OPTIONS ##

The <span class="tool">deg</span> command provides the following options:

<span class="option">h</span>

displays a help screen summarizing the command syntax

-k *key*

specify default key

-K *key*

specify override key

<span class="option">t</span>

suppresses printing of all but the first note of a group of tied
`**kern notes`

<span class="option">x</span>

suppresses printing of
non-`**deg signifiers   Options are specified in the command line. `

The <span class="option">t</span> option ensures that only a single output value is given for
tied <span class="rep">kern</span> notes; the output coincides with the first note of the
tie.

In the default operation, <span class="tool">deg</span> outputs non-pitch-related signifiers
in addition to the degree value. For example, in the key of D major, the
<span class="rep">pitch</span> token \"G5zzz\" will result in the output \"4zzz\" &mdash; that
is, after translating G5 to 4, the \"zzz\" signifiers are retained in
the output. For some applications, echoing non-pitch-related signifiers
in the output is useful. However, in other situations, the result can
prove confusing &mdash; especially, when the non-pitch-related signifiers
are numbers. Consider the case of the <span class="rep">kern</span> token \"4f\#\" in the key
of D minor; after translating \``f#`\' to \``3+`\' (i.e. raised third
degree), the preceding non-pitch-related signifier \``4`\' will also be
output, hence the value `43+` &mdash; which may cause confusion.

The <span class="option">x</span> option is useful for eliminating non-pitch-related signifiers
from the output. For most <span class="rep">kern</span> inputs, the <span class="option">x</span> option is
recommended.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## EXAMPLES ##

The following example illustrates the use of <span class="tool">deg</span>. The input contains
four pitch-related spines &mdash; one of which (<span class="rep">MIDI</span>) cannot be
processed by <span class="tool">deg</span>. In addition, there is one non-pitch-related spines
(<span class="rep">embell</span>).

Both processed and unprocessed spines are output. Notice that the tied
note at the beginning of measure 2 in the <span class="rep">kern</span> spine has been
rendered as a single note rather than as two notes (due to the <span class="option">t</span>
option). Also notice that the non-pitch-related signifiers (e.g. foo) in
the first notes of the <span class="rep">pitch</span> spine have been stripped away (due to
the <span class="option">x</span> option). Note that the plus and minus signs merely indicate
that a scale degree has been raised or lowered, but not by how much.
Hence both the D-flat and D double-flat in measure 1 of the first
(<span class="rep">kern</span>) spine are rendered as \``2-`\'.
