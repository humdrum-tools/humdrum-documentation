### COMMAND

<span class="tool">urrhythm</span> &mdash; characterize Johnson-Laird rhythmic prototypes in a
Humdrum passage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## SYNOPSIS ##

` urrhythm  inputfile  [ > outputfile.urr]`

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## DESCRIPTION ##

The <span class="tool">urrhythm</span> command outputs a single Humdrum spine (<span class="rep">URrhythm</span>)
containing data representing rhythmic \`prototypes\' (Ur-rhythms)
evident in a musical passage. The command implements a variation of
Johnson-Laird's theory of rhythmic prototypes (see
[REFERENCES](#REFERENCES) below). In order to identify the rhythmic
prototypes, <span class="tool">urrhythm</span> requires information about note onsets and
metric position. These may be provided via two input spines: <span class="rep">kern</span>
(or <span class="rep">recip</span>) and <span class="rep">metpos</span>.

Johnson-Laird's rhythmic-prototype theory can be applied only to
musical passages conforming to some established metric context, such as
2/4, 3/2, or 12/8 meters. The <span class="tool">urrhythm</span> command handles all regular
types of meters (simple and compound, duple, triple and quadruple).
Specifically, any meter having a \"numerator\" of 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, or 12
can be processed. **Urrhym** adapts to changes of meter, but is unable
to handle irregular meters. If an irregular meter is encountered in the
input an error is generated and the command terminates.

<span class="tool">urrhythm</span> characterizes each beat in a passage as belonging to one of
three beat types: *Note* (N), *Syncopation* (S), or *Other* (O). Only
major beats are characterized in this way. Hence, in 3/4 or 9/8 meters,
three beats will be characterized for each complete measure. Similarly,
in 4/2 and 12/16, four beats will be characterized for each complete
measure.

A \"Note\" (signified in the output by the letter \`N\') is defined as a
beat that coincides with a note onset.

A \"Syncopation\" (signified by the letter \`S\') is defined as arising
when no note-onset happens on a beat whose position in the metric
hierarchy is greater than that of the most recent note onset. By way of
example, imagine a measure in 4/4 meter containing a quarter-note,
followed by a half-note, followed by a quarter-note. The third beat
position does not coincide with a note onset. The most recent note onset
prior to the third beat occurs on beat two. Since beat three is a more
important metric position than beat two, beat three is deemed to be
syncopated.

Syncopated beats can happen only after the first note onset; subsequent
syncopated moments will require another note onset (i.e. two syncopated
moments can't occur in a row without some note onset intervening).

An \"Other\" (signified by the letter \`O\') is any beat that is not a
Note (N) or a syncopation (S).

It is recommended that output files produced using the <span class="tool">urrhythm</span>
command should be given names with the distinguishing \`.urr\'
extension.

## OPTIONS ##

The <span class="tool">urrhythm</span> command provides only a help option:

-------- -------------------------------------------------------
<span class="option">h</span>   displays a help screen summarizing the command syntax
-------- -------------------------------------------------------

Options are specified in the command line.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## EXAMPLES ##

The following example illustrates the operation of <span class="tool">urrhythm</span>. The
first two spines (<span class="rep">kern</span> and <span class="rep">metpos</span>) constitute the input. The
third spine (<span class="rep">URrhythm</span>) is added by the <span class="tool">urrhythm</span> command. All
three spines are given in the output. ``

## WARNINGS ##

The <span class="tool">urrhythm</span> command is currently unable to handle Humdrum
spine-path changes &mdash; such as join-path, exchange-path, or split-path.
If spine-path changes are encountered an error is issued and the command
terminates.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## PORTABILITY ##

DOS 2.0 and up, with the MKS Toolkit. OS/2 with the MKS Toolkit. UNIX
systems supporting the *Korn* shell or *Bourne* shell command
interpreters, and revised *awk* (1985).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## SEE ALSO ##

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## NOTE ##

The <span class="tool">urrhythm</span> command differs from Johnson-Laird's theory in the
definition of syncopation. Johnson-Laird's theory requires that a
listener be able to identify a syncopation retrospectively. That is, a
listener is able to determine whether the current beat is a syncopation,
only by determining what happens at the beginning of the next beat. The
algorithm used here avoids the theoretical assumption of backward
listening. (See [Simpson & Huron,
1993](/Humdrum/Huron/publications.html).)
