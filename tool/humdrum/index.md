### COMMAND

<span class="tool">humdrum</span> &mdash; general syntax checker for Humdrum files

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## SYNOPSIS ##

` humdrum  [-v]  [inputfile ...]`

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## DESCRIPTION ##

The <span class="tool">humdrum</span> command identifies whether an input conforms to the
Humdrum representation syntax. Error messages are issued where
appropriate. If the input conforms to the Humdrum syntax, then the
<span class="tool">humdrum</span> command produces no output, unless the verbose (<span class="option">v</span>)
option is invoked.

Formally, a Humdrum representation may be defined as any ASCII input
containing zero or more *comments, data records* or *interpretations*
&mdash; with the restriction that no *data records* or *local comments*
appear without a prior *exclusive interpretation,* and that the file
maintain a coherent *spine* organization.

Humdrum comments are records (lines) that begin with an exclamation mark
(!). Local comments begin each active spine with a single exclamation
mark, whereas gobal comments begin with two exclamation marks (!!) at
the beginning of the record.

Humdrum interpretations are records that begin with an asterisk (\*).
Tandem interpretations begin each active spine with a single asterisk,
whereas exclusive interpretations begin the record with one or more
asterisks and have at least one active spine beginning with two
asterisks. Spine-path indicators are special types of interpretations
that include any one of the following tokens: \*+ \*- \*v \*\^ or \*x.
Spine-path indicators cannot appear on the same line with a tandem or
exclusive interpretation.

Any record that does not begin with either an exclamation mark of
asterisk is a data record.

The following table defines some of the pertinent Humdrum terminology.

---------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------
*record*                     a line of text; a sequences of (zero or more) ASCII characters
terminated by a carriage return or newline character
*data record*                any *record* which is not a *comment* or an *interpretation*
*comment*                    a *global* or *local comment*
*global comment*             any *record* beginning with two exclamation marks (!!)
*local comment*              any *record* beginning with a single exclamation mark (!)
*interpretation*             an *exclusive* or *tandem interpretation*, or a *spine-path indicator*
*exclusive interpretation*   any *record* beginning with one or more asterisks (\*\*) and
having at least one active spine beginning with two asterisks
*tandem interpretation*      any *record* in which each active spine begins with a single
asterisk, excluding spine-path indicators
*spine-path indicator*       one of the following five *interpretations*: \*+ \*- \*v \*\^ \*x
*null token*                 the period (.) either alone on a single *record* or
separated from other characters by tabs
*spine*                      a column of information &mdash; including *data records, local*
*comments*, and *interpretations.*
---------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Some Humdrum Definitions*

The following files may satisfy the Humdrum syntactical requirements:

-   a file containing data records preceded by at least one exclusive
    interpretation
-   a file containing only comments and interpretations
-   a file containing only interpretations
-   a file containing only global comments
-   a totally empty file.

Additional interpretations may be added throughout the file. Global
comments may appear anywhere in the file. Local comments and data
records can appear only after a spine has been initiated via an
exclusive interpretation.

Illegal constructions in Humdrum include the following:

-   empty record (i.e. a record containing only a carriage return or
    newline)
-   record containing only tabs
-   any record beginning with a tab
-   any record ending with a tab (except in a global comment)
-   any record containing two successive tab characters (except in a
    global comment)
-   any data record with fewer or more spines than the immediately
    preceding data or exclusive interpretation record
-   spine-path record containing only one join-spine indication
-   spine-path record containing only one exchange-spine indication, or
    containing more than two exchange-spine indicators.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## SPINE ORGANIZATION ##

A Humdrum file must maintain a coherent spine organization. Spines are
columns of information separated by tabs. Each spine must be labelled
with an exclusive interpretation. If the number of spines varies in a
given file, spines must be added, terminated, split, joined, or
exchanged using the appropriate spine path indicators. Spines may (1)
start, (2) terminate, (3) split (into two), (4) join (*n*-into-one), and
(5) exchange.

------ ----------------------------------------
`*+`   \- start a new spine
`*-`   \- terminate a current spine
`*^`   \- split a spine (into two)
`*v`   \- join (two or more) spines into one
`*x`   \- exchange the position of two spines
------ ----------------------------------------

## OPTIONS ##

The <span class="tool">humdrum</span> command provides the following options:

-------- -------------------------------------------------------
<span class="option">h</span>   displays a help screen summarizing the command syntax
<span class="option">v</span>   verbose mode
-------- -------------------------------------------------------

Options are specified in the command line.

The <span class="option">v</span> option invokes the verbose mode which provides summary
information and statistics concerning the input file. A list of all of
interpretations found in the file is output. In addition, an inventory
of all of the ASCII signifiers (characters) found in the data records is
output. The total number of data records is also provided, as well as
the number of null tokens encountered.

The verbose summary also produces a number of statistics related to the
spine-organization in the Humdrum file. Both the minimum and maximum
number of spines are identified. The paths of the various spines through
the file are also summarized. Specifically, <span class="tool">humdrum</span> indicates the
number of terminated spines, the number of new spines introduced, the
number of joined spines, the number of split spines, and the number of
exchanged spines.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## EXAMPLES ##

The following is a sample input that conforms to the Humdrum syntax.

## FILES ##

The <span class="tool">humdrum</span> command uses a kornshell script to invoke an executable.
In order to avoid conflict, the executable file is named `humdrum_.exe`
(`humdrum_` on UNIX) rather than `humdrum.exe`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## PORTABILITY ##

DOS 2.0 and up, with the MKS Toolkit. OS/2 with the MKS Toolkit. UNIX
systems supporting the *Korn* shell or *Bourne* shell command
interpreters, and revised *awk* (1985).
