### COMMAND

<span class="tool">cleave</span> &mdash; join tokens from two or more Humdrum spines into a single
output spine

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## SYNOPSIS ##

` cleave [-r] [-d delim] -i '**in_interp1[,**in_interp2 ...]' -o '**out_interp' [inputfile ...]`

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## DESCRIPTION ##

The <span class="tool">cleave</span> command permits concurrent data tokens in two or more
specified spines to be amalgamated into a single data token and output
in a single new spine. Consider, for example, two input spines
containing pitch information and duration information respectively;
<span class="tool">cleave</span> can be used to form a new spine that combines the pitch and
duration signifiers into a single representation.

When the <span class="tool">cleave</span> command is invoked, the user identifies the input
spines to be combined and specifies the name of the resulting output
spine. Only a single output spine can be generated by <span class="tool">cleave</span>.

If necessary, the user may specify delimiter characters that are
inserted between the component parts of the combined data token. (See
EXAMPLES below.)

The <span class="tool">cleave</span> command amalgamates all spines containing the
interpretation(s) specified by the user. For example, the command:

` cleave -i '**recip,**kern' -o '**output' katsumi`

will amalgamate all spines in the file `katsumi` containing <span class="rep">recip</span> or
<span class="rep">kern</span> data &mdash; and will output the amalgamated data in a spine
labelled <span class="rep">output</span>.

Note that the output spine generated by <span class="tool">cleave</span> preserves the same
record-type structure as the input, and so may readily be pasted with
the input file using the Humdrum <span class="tool">assemble</span> command.

The <span class="tool">cleave</span> command is able to adapt to spine-path changes throughout
the input. When a processed input spine is *split,* the new spine
participates in the amalgamated output spine. When a processed spine is
*exchanged,* <span class="tool">cleave</span> continues to track its location. When a new
spine is *added,* to the input it is included in the amalgamated output
only if its interpretation matches one of the interpretations being
processed. When a processed spine is *terminated,* <span class="tool">cleave</span> continues
to process other spines in the input; if no target spine remains, then
null tokens are generated until the end of the input or until other
target interpretations appear. *Join*-spine indicators have no affect on
the output.

Notice that the <span class="tool">cleave</span> command is useful for transforming a spine
that periodically splits and joins into a single spine containing
multiple-stops.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## OPTIONS ##

The <span class="tool">cleave</span> command provides the following options:

---------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------
-d *delimiter*         interpose the string *delimiter* between amalgamated tokens
-i *\'in\_interp\'*    list of input interpretations to be processed
-o *\'out\_interp\'*   specify output interpretation
<span class="option">r</span>                 suppress outputting of duplicate (repeated) signifiers
---------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------

Options are specified in the command line.

The <span class="option">d</span> option is used to specify a string that is inserted between
each component part forming the assembled output token. The default
delimiter is the null string.

A given signifier (character) may be present in two or more concurrent
input tokens &mdash; such as the letter \`A\' shared by the tokens \`AB\'
and \`AX\'. Depending on the task, the user may want only a single
instance of each signifier to be echoed in the output (e.g. \`ABX\'
rather than \`ABAX\'). The <span class="option">r</span> option causes characters that are
common to two or more input tokens to be output only once. The output
position of any repeated character corresponds to the first instance of
the character in the processed input.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## EXAMPLES ##

The following examples illustrate the operation of the <span class="tool">cleave</span>
command.

Consider the following input consisting of four spines representing
octave-class, diatonic pitch letter name, accidental, and
cents-deviation: ``

<span class="rep">oct</span>

<span class="rep">diaton</span>

<span class="rep">accid</span>

<span class="rep">Cdev</span>

`4`

`G`

`.`

`A`

`F`

`#`

`+12`

`5`

`G`

`.`

`.`

`*-`

`*-`

`*-`

`*- ` The information available in these four spines might be
amalgamated into a single spine by executing the following command:

` cleave -i '**diaton,**accid,**oct,**Cdev' -o '**pitch' input`

The following output would be produced: ``

<span class="rep">pitch</span>

`G4`

`A4`

`Bb4-10`

`C5`

`D5`

`Eb5`

`F#5+12`

`G5`

`*- ` The output interpretation has been specified as <span class="rep">pitch</span>.
Notice that the order of the signifiers in each output data token
reflects the order of the input interpretations given in the command
line &mdash; i.e., <span class="rep">diaton</span> values first, followed by <span class="rep">accid</span>,
followed by <span class="rep">oct</span>, followed by <span class="rep">Cdev</span>. In the case of <span class="rep">accid</span>
and <span class="rep">Cdev</span> data, notice that null tokens (periods) do not affect
the output token. In the default invocation, note that no
intervening characters are placed between the joined subtokens.

In the following example, <span class="tool">cleave</span> is used to create double-stops
from two spines having identical interpretations. Notice the
presence of barlines. ``

<span class="rep">kern</span>

<span class="rep">kern</span>

`8cc`

`8b`

`8dd`

`=3`

`=3`

`4cc`

`4ee`

`*-`

`*- ` Executing the command

` cleave -i '**kern' -d ' ' -o '**kern' input > output`

will produce the following output: ``

<span class="rep">kern</span>

`*M2/4`

`*`

`=1 =1`

`4c 4e`

`8d 8f`

`8e 8g`

`=2 =2`

`8f 8a`

`8g 8b`

`8a 8cc`

`8b 8dd`

`=3 =3`

`4cc 4ee`

`*- ` Notice that if identical tandem interpretations appear in
the target spines, then they are echoed in the output. Otherwise
a null interpretation is output.

The redundant measure numbers in the above output might be
eliminated using the following <span class="tool">humsed</span>
command:

` humsed '/^=/s/ .*//' input > output`

Alternatively, the input might have been preprocessed so that
the barlines in one of the two input spines were replaced by
null tokens.

The <span class="option">r</span> option can be used to eliminate duplicate or repeated
signifiers. Consider, for example, the following input: ``

<span class="rep">kern</span>

<span class="rep">kern</span>

`.`

`4c`

`(8`

`8d`

`)8`

`8e`

`(`

`8f`

`)`

`8g`

`8'`

`8a`

`8'`

`8b`

`.`

`4cc`

`*-`

`*- ` The first <span class="rep">kern</span> spine includes articulation
information not present in the second spine. The pitch,
duration, and articulation information can be amalgamated
without duplication of the duration information using the
<span class="option">r</span> option:

` cleave -r -i '**kern' -o '**kern' input > output`

The resulting output is: ``

<span class="rep">kern</span>

`4c`

`(8d`

`)8e`

`(8f`

`)8g`

`8'a`

`8'b`

`4cc`

`*- ` Users should be careful when using the <span class="option">r</span> option
while at the same time assigning a delimiter that appears in
the input stream. For example, if the slash (/) is defined
as an output delimiter, and the <span class="option">r</span> option is invoked,
then following input: ``

`ab`

`a/b ` will produce the following output: ``

`ab// ` Note that the first slash in the above output
delimits the material originally contained in the left
and right spines. The second slash is a bona fide
signifier in the right spine. If the delimiter in the
above example was a space rather than a slash, then the
result would produce trailing spaces &mdash; and so the
output would no longer conform to the Humdrum syntax.

### PORTABILITY

DOS 2.0 and up, with the MKS Toolkit. OS/2 with the MKS
Toolkit. UNIX systems supporting the *Korn* shell or
*Bourne* shell command interpreters, and revised *awk*
(1985).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### SEE ALSO

`  assemble (4),  extract (4),  humsed (4),  rend (4)`

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### WARNINGS

Syntactically correct Humdrum output is not guaranteed
if the <span class="option">r</span> option is invoked while using the space as
a delimiter.

The use of regular expression metacharacters as
delimiters (such as \^) can cause problems for
<span class="tool">cleave</span>.
