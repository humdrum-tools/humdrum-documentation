### COMMAND

<span class="tool">record</span> &mdash; record live MIDI input in Humdrum <span class="rep">MIDI</span> data format

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## SYNOPSIS ##

` record  [-i hex]  [-q n]  [ > outputfile.hmd]`

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## DESCRIPTION ##

The <span class="tool">record</span> command captures a stream of input MIDI data and
translates this data into a simple Humdrum <span class="rep">MIDI</span> representation.
Input MIDI data is obtained through a Roland MPU-401 (or compatible)
interface &mdash; usually connected in turn to a MIDI synthesizer. The
obtained <span class="rep">MIDI</span> data can be manipulated using several Humdrum tools,
or it can be played-back using the <span class="tool">perform</span> command.

Recording commences as soon as the command is invoked. Recording ceases
when any ASCII key is pressed &mdash; with the exception of the space bar.
Only MIDI key-press activity (including after-touch) information is
recorded. MIDI system-exclusive instructions and other non-key-press
data are not recorded.

Each MIDI channel is represented using a separate Humdrum spine. New
spines are added automatically during the recording &mdash; in response to
additional activity on new MIDI channels. Once a MIDI channel becomes
active, the corresponding Humdrum spine continues to be output until the
recording is terminated.

At any time during the recording process, pressing the space bar will
insert a <span class="rep">MIDI</span> barline data token in the output stream. Measure
numbers are incremented automatically beginning with measure 1.

It is recommended that output files produced using the <span class="tool">record</span>
command should be given names with the distinguishing \`.hmd\'
extension.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## OPTIONS ##

The <span class="tool">record</span> command provides the following option:

---------- ---------------------------------------------------------------
<span class="option">h</span>     displays a help screen summarizing the command syntax
-i *hex*   assign MIDI interface input/output address to *hex*
-q *n*     invokes quantizing using a temporal window of *n* clock ticks
---------- ---------------------------------------------------------------

Options are specified in the command line.

The <span class="option">q</span> option invokes a quantizing function where timing information
is rounded-off to a specified level of resolution. This option may be
used to eliminate expressive timing information and assist in producing
a canonical duration representation. The degree of quantizing is
specified by the *n* argument to the <span class="option">q</span> option, where *n* represents
the quantizing window in MIDI clock ticks. Recorded events occurring
within this window are deemed to be simultaneous, and are recorded as
Humdrum double-stops in the output.

The <span class="option">i</span> option is used to specify the input/output address of the
MIDI card. The default address is \`330.\' The address is specified as a
hexadecimal number.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## SAMPLE OUTPUT ##

The following examples illustrate how <span class="tool">record</span> may be used. A simple
command invocation is:

` record`

Output <span class="rep">MIDI</span> data may appears as follows: ``

-------------------------------------
!! Data from the MPU-401 MIDI card.

-------------------------------------

Using the quantizing option:

` record -q 10`

might produce output such as the following <span class="rep">MIDI</span> data. Notice the
frequent occurrence of multiple-stops (more than one note-instruction in
the spine). ``
